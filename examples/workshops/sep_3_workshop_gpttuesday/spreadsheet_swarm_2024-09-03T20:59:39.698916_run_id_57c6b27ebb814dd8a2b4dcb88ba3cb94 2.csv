This code is efficient and easy to understand. Before running the code, ensure that you have the `qrcode` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't done so already:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

Here is the Python code to create a QR code for the specified Telegram link:

```python
import qrcode

# Define the Telegram link
telegram_link = ""https://t.me/+Sm4J-sSkw8c0ODA5""

# Create a QR code object
qr = qrcode.QRCode(
    version=1,  # Controls the size of the QR Code
    error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_L,  # Error correction level
    box_size=10,  # Size of each box in the QR code
    border=4,  # Thickness of the border (minimum is 4)
)

# Add the Telegram link to the QR code
qr.add_data(telegram_link)
qr.make(fit=True)

# Create an image from the QR Code instance
img = qr.make_image(fill_color=""black"", back_color=""white"")

# Save the image to a file
img.save(""telegram_qr_code.png"")

print(""QR code generated and saved as 'telegram_qr_code.png'"")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Import the Library**: The `qrcode` library is imported to handle QR code generation.
2. **Define the Link**: The Telegram link is defined as a string.
3. **Create QR Code Object**: A `QRCode` object is created with specific parameters:
   - `version`: Controls the size of the QR code.
   - `error_correction`: Determines the error correction level (L, M, Q, H).
   - `box_size`: Size of each box in the QR code.
   - `border`: Thickness of the border around the QR code.
4. **Add Data**: The Telegram link is added to the QR code.
5. **Make Image**: An image of the QR code is created with specified fill and background colors.
6. **Save the Image**: The generated QR code image is saved as ""telegram_qr_code.png"".
7. **Print Confirmation**: A message is printed to confirm that the QR code has been generated and saved.

### Validation:
To validate the code, you can run it in your Python environment. After executing, check the directory where you ran the script for the file named `telegram_qr_code.png`.
