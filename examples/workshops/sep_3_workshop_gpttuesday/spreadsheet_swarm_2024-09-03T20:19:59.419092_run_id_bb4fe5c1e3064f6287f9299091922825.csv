4. **Task Assignment:** Users can assign tasks related to specific cells or ranges within the spreadsheet, ensuring that everyone knows their responsibilities and deadlines.

5. **Customizable Views:** Different team members can customize their view of the spreadsheet, focusing on the data that is most relevant to their tasks without altering the main view for others.

6. **Integration with Other Tools:** The feature often integrates seamlessly with other productivity tools, such as project management software or data visualization tools. This interoperability can streamline workflows and enhance overall productivity.
