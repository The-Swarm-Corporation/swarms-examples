**Current Zoning:**
The properties are currently zoned as MU-1 (Mixed Use-1) and RM-25 (Residential Multifamily-25), according to the City of Fort Lauderdale's zoning map.

**Highest and Best Use:**
Given the location and zoning, I would recommend a mixed-use development that incorporates residential, office, and retail components. This type of development would be consistent with the city's vision for the downtown area and would take advantage of the site's proximity to public transportation, restaurants, and entertainment venues.

**Potential Development Scenario:**
A possible development scenario could include:

* 4-5 stories of residential units (approx. 20-25 units)
* Rooftop amenities, such as a pool, gym, and lounge area

**Zoning and Land Use Considerations:**
To maximize the investment, I would recommend the following:

* Seek a zoning amendment to MU-2 (Mixed Use-2) or MU-3 (Mixed Use-3) to allow for a higher density and more intense mixed-use development.
* Pursue a density bonus through the city's density bonus program, which could provide additional floor area ratio (FAR) and height entitlements.
* Consider incorporating affordable housing units to take advantage of the city's affordable housing incentives.

**Environmental and Regulatory Considerations:**

* The site is located in a flood zone, and therefore, would require a floodplain permit and compliance with the city's floodplain management regulations.
* The site is also located near the Tarpon River, and therefore, would require permits and approvals from the South Florida Water Management District and the City of Fort Lauderdale's Environmental Services Department.

**Historic Preservation Considerations:**
There are no historic buildings on the site, and therefore, no historic preservation considerations would apply.

**Next Steps:**
To move forward with the development, I would recommend the following:
