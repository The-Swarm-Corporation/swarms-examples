Here's my expert advice:

**Current Zoning:**
The properties are located in the Downtown Fort Lauderdale area, which falls under the City's Downtown Master Plan. According to the City's zoning map, the properties are zoned as ""Downtown Mixed-Use"" (DMU) with a ""Downtown Core"" (DC) overlay.

**Best Use of the Land:**
Considering the DMU zoning and DC overlay, the best use of the land would be a mixed-use development that combines residential, office, and retail components. This could include:

1. Multifamily residential units (apartments or condos) with ground-floor retail and office space.
2. A mixed-use building with office space, retail, and restaurants on the lower floors, and residential units on the upper floors.
3. A boutique hotel or a hospitality-related development that incorporates retail and dining options.

**Maximizing Investment:**
To maximize your investment, consider the following strategies:

1. **Density Bonus:** The City of Fort Lauderdale offers density bonuses for developments that incorporate affordable housing, public art, or other community benefits. By incorporating these elements, you may be able to increase the allowed density and build more units.
2. **Height Increase:** The DC overlay allows for a height increase to 450 feet, subject to review and approval by the City. This could enable you to build a more substantial project with more units and better views.
3. **Parking Reduction:** The City allows for reduced parking requirements for mixed-use developments in the Downtown area. This could help reduce construction costs and increase the overall efficiency of the project.
4. **Incentives:** The City offers various incentives for developments that meet specific criteria, such as the ""Downtown Incentive Program"" or the ""Affordable Housing Incentive Program."" These incentives could provide financial benefits or streamlined permitting processes.
5. **Assemblage:** Consider assembling adjacent properties to create a larger development site. This could allow for a more substantial project with greater economies of scale.

**Next Steps:**

1. Conduct a thorough market analysis to determine the demand for different types of developments in the area.
2. Engage with the City's planning department to discuss your project concept and determine the feasibility of your proposal.
3. Hire a qualified architect and engineer to design a project that meets the City's zoning regulations and your investment goals.
4. Submit a preliminary development application to the City to initiate the review and approval process.

By following these steps and leveraging the City's zoning regulations and incentives, you can maximize your investment and create a successful mixed-use development in the heart of Downtown Fort Lauderdale.**Additional Recommendations:**

1. **Environmental Impact Assessment:** As the properties are located in a coastal area, you may need to conduct an environmental impact assessment to ensure that your development does not harm the surrounding ecosystem.
2. **Historic Preservation:** Although the properties are not located in a designated historic district, it's essential to verify that your development does not impact any nearby historic resources.
3. **Coastal Construction Regulations:** Familiarize yourself with the City's coastal construction regulations, including setback requirements, to ensure that your development complies with these regulations.
4. **Community Engagement:** Engage with the local community to understand their concerns and expectations for the development. This can help you build support for your project and ensure that it aligns with the community's vision.
5. **Phased Development:** Consider phasing your development to allow for more flexibility and to mitigate potential risks. This could involve developing the properties in stages, with each phase building upon the previous one.

**Zoning Category Breakdown:**

* **Downtown Mixed-Use (DMU):** This zoning category allows for a mix of residential, office, and retail uses. It provides flexibility in terms of building design and layout, but also requires a minimum amount of open space and amenities.
* **Downtown Core (DC) Overlay:** This overlay district provides additional regulations and guidelines for developments in the Downtown area. It includes requirements for building height, density, and design, as well as incentives for developments that incorporate public art, affordable housing, or other community benefits.

**Potential Density and Height:**

* **Base Density:** The DMU zoning category allows for a base density of 150 units per acre.
* **Density Bonus:** By incorporating affordable housing, public art, or other community benefits, you may be able to increase the allowed density to 250 units per acre or more.
* **Height:** The DC overlay allows for a maximum building height of 450 feet, subject to review and approval by the City.

**Parking Requirements:**

* **Base Parking:** The City requires a minimum of 1 parking space per 1,000 square feet of office space and 1 parking space per 2 residential units.
* **Parking Reduction:** The City allows for reduced parking requirements for mixed-use developments in the Downtown area. This could help reduce construction costs and increase the overall efficiency of the project.
