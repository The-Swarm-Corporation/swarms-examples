    "rules": "Each agent is responsible for generating a code snippet in a specific programming language that sends an API request to OpenAI's API. The agents must ensure the code is efficient, follows best practices, and includes necessary error handling. Agents should report back with the code snippet and any relevant notes on execution.",
    "plan": "The goal is to create a swarm of agents that can generate code snippets for sending API requests to OpenAI's API in various programming languages. This will help users quickly implement API calls in their preferred language. The plan involves creating agents for the following languages: Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, and Kotlin.",
