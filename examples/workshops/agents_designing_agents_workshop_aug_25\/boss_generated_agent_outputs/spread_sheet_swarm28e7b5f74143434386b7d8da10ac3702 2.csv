### Instructions to Run the Game:
1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Copy the code into a Python file, for example, `dimension_shifter.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python dimension_shifter.py
   ```
4. Use the arrow keys to move the player and press the spacebar to shift dimensions. Avoid the black obstacles!",2024-08-24T18:43:58.791110
