Compute & Networking revenue – The increa se in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2024 was due to strengt h in Data Center computing and networking for accelerat ed computing and AI solutions. Revenue from GPU computing grew 166% year-
on-year and 257% compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU architecture computin g platform for training and
inferencing of large language models, recomm endation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was also up 114% year-on-year and 159%
compared to the first half  of last year driven by both InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue.
28Graphics revenue  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first  half of fiscal year 2024 was led
by higher sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compa red to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2024 in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.
All Other operating loss – The incre ase in the second  quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024
was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and c ompensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises  and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal year 2025, r espectively , and 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively .
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct cus tomers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integ rators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal re sources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service provide rs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Comp ute & Networking segment, are
presented in the following table:
 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended

Customer A 14 % 14 %
Customer B 11 % *
Customer C 11 % *
Customer D 10 %  10 %
Customer E * 10 %
* Less than 10% of total revenue
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distrib utors, including
through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represent 10% or more of total revenue attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
For the first half of fiscal year 202 5, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products from system integrators and distributors, including from
Customer E, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable  to the Compute & Networking segment.
Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data
 and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may dif fer from our estimates.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,  and this trend may continue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.
Our overall gross margi n increased to 75.1% and 76.6% for the second quart er and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , from 70.1% and 68.2% for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The increases in the second quarter and first half  of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 154% and 234% for the second quarter and first half of
 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively ,  and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 millio n and $199 million for the second quarter  and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively . The net effect on
our
29gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $576 million and $709 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal  year 2024,
respectively . Sales of previously reserved invent ory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $84 million and
$134 million  for the seco nd quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 3.6% and
2.8% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, re spectively .
We expect our Data Center mix to continue to shift to new products in the second half of fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in
the mid-70% range.

The increases in research and development expenses for the second q uarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 were driven by 35% and 34% increase in
compensation and benefits, including stock-bas ed compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases,  and 118% and 117% increase in
compute and infrastructure investments, respectively .
The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 20 25 was primarily driven by compensation and
benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.
For fiscal year 2025, we expect operating expenses to g row in the mid to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products.

The increas es in interest income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 was due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and publicly-held debt
secu rity balances.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other , net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in  privately-held equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact
of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other , net, compared to the second quarter and first half of fis cal year 2024 was primarily driven by an
increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statem ents in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity
securities.
30Income T axes
We recognized i ncome tax expense of $2.6 billion and $5.0 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and $793 million and
$958 million for the second quarter and first half of  fiscal year 2024, respectively . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.6%
and 13.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and 11.4%  and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,
respectively .
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intang ible income deduction relative to the increase
in income before income tax.
Given our current and anticipated future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation  allowance associated with c ertain state deferred tax assets in
the near term, which would decrease our income  tax expense for the period the release is recor ded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release
could  vary based on our assessment of all available evidence.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (8, 877) $ (1,287)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,665) $ (5,479)
Our investm ent policy requires the purchase of high-rated fixed income securities, the diversi fication of investment types a nd credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024  due to growth in revenue, partially
offset by higher tax paym ents. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2025 reflects the strong revenue growth, partially offse t
by $2.8 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal  year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of
marketable securities, and acquisition of land and buildings.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared  to the first half of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 28, 2024, we
had $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liqui dity to meet our operating requirements for at least
the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our  liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-he ld equity securities,  debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by hig hly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt
securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Co nsolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
31Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable se curities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities held outside the U.S.
as of July 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Payment from customers, per our standard paym ent term s, is generally due shortly after delivery  of products, availability of software licenses or commencement
of services.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the second quarter and first half of fisca l year 2025, we paid $246 million and $344 million, respectively , in quarterly cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our  Board of Directors' continuing determination that the
dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On June 7, 2024, we increased our qua rterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024. Our
quarterly cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024.
During the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and
$15.1 billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were authorized, su bject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock. On
August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approve d an additional $50.0 billion to our share repurchase authoriz ation, without expiration. As of August 26, 2024, a
total of $53.9 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while main taining
adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment
opportunities. W e plan to continue share repu rchases this fiscal year .
From April 29, 2024 through August 26, 2024, we repurchased 31.5 million shares for $3.6 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The U.S. Inflation Reduc tion Act of  2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost a nd was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $186 million recorded in non-current income tax p ayable as of
July 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability , interest payme nts, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the
underlying income tax  positions and the timing of
32the ef fective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the cont ractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations
from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for th e fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report o n Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024
for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations,  refer to Notes 2,
11, and 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively .
Climate Change
To date, there has been  no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing
renewable energy or climate-related business trends.
Adoption of New  and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
There has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”
in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. As of July 28, 2024, there have been no material changes to the financial market
risks described as of January 28, 2024.
Fore ign Exchange Rate Risk
The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About

foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 20 24.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of July 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
i nformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and f orms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions reg arding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or ar e reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update  much of
our existing core financia l systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will
occur in phases. W e will cont inue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ  ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control sys tem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must re flect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation o f controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.
33Part II. Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Pa rt I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “L egal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk facto rs liste d below , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A  of our  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA  common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Ite m 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024, and below . Any
one of  those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends  and uncertainties not present ly known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
Long manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply an d component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,
has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and asse mb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component
or capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a  quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in  both product shortages and
excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advanc e of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments f or capacity to address our business needs, or our
long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary fo r the
finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited  supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 m onths. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scal e their capabilities to meet
our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply
commitments at th e same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our pr oducts,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
 •competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•changes in business and economic conditions;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues ;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting  in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end-use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products;
•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated computing,  AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
34•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products; or
•government a ctions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
We continue to increase our supply and capacit y purchases with existing and new supplier s to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have
also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.  The increased purchase
volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with
variations in productio n planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to
increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incu r inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments
exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may cha nge or may not be correct, as we have
experienced in the past.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare  to ship and support
new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.
The computing industr y is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center arc hitectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year
and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the la rger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating
product transi tions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in
our revenue . We have experienced and may in the fut ure experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate
transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and f uture architecture transitions. If we are unable to
execute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and comp lexity of
newly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other
costs or result in produc t delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory pro visions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the
future.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product road map may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may  not be
able to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple pro duct archit ectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customer s often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through
multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by o ur multiple OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have
impacted and c ould in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various
downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers'  future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely  basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be
able to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient sup ply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill
our custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputa tion
could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any
one component have had and may  have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able  to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have imple mented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a  result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and rec orded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of
our historical  lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of
35these impac ts has increased and may continue  to increase as our purchase obligations an d prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and
become a greater portion of our total supply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Demand  estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to
generate significant revenue from them. Recent   technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for
Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multi ple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with
any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
Challenges  in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natur al disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,  contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed a nd marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future
impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, se veral years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to
be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact  of
cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price change s in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in
the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the futu re impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further
impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not  limited to, the Ethereum 2.0
merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sale s of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or
previously sold products may be resold online or on the unau thorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and
reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.
Additionally , we depend  on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publi shers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by
developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our p latforms, or failure by third-party content providers
or publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adverse ly affect
customer demand.
We receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to
customers who purchase directly or  indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of
these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited numb er of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to direct Customers, A, B,
C and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal  year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to
the Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio throug h their
channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. We have a small number of  partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly
complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key custome rs. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their
ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to custome rs. In the future, these
partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.
Because most of  our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little
notice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or custome rs may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and
our partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our pr oducts, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’
purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,  distributors
and other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators
and distributors, includin g through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &
Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supp ly availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors
and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amoun t of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them,
36our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to whic h our business is subject, and political and other actions may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas inclu ding, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; impor t and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreig n exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; data priva cy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and s afety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,  and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to
manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not  violate applicable laws
or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions
against us,  our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations
to which we are subject, or changes to their inte rpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For  example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result
of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity v ulnerabilities and risks.
Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,
the United Ki ngdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Author ity collected information from us regarding our business and
competition in the graph ics card and cloud service provider marke t as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received
requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, a nd South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs,
our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions
on the hardw are, software, and system s used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June
2024 and will be implemented in phases betwee n now and 2030. The State of Calif ornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions
under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, d elay or halt deployment of new systems
using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or
regulation s or their interpretation and enforceme nt could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or  exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our
shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in  the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our
business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security polic ies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sa nctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with  entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligation s and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation oc curred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial co ndition.
For example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, s ervices and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukr aine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that ta rget products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.
Concerns regardin g third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the f uture result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and c ould in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our busines s and financial results.
37Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.
As ge opolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export
control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in t he U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to Chi na, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively a nd materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be furthe r tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvanta ge for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream use rs of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our  cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end custom ers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gam ing products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less  likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impactin g our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial  results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to inclu de deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restric tions may not only impact our ability to serve
overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide  our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our
sales and efforts to supply the China m arket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators
conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any app licable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions
on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating  results and financial condition.
During the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and
supercompu ting industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including  Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing r equirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circu its. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second qu arter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countr ies in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Group s D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A80 0, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate par ent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H80 0, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validatio n, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distri bution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for
which the USG does not require a  license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing
requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing  process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a
license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved,  it may impose burdensome conditions that
we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that
38does not have clear standard s or an opportunity  for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for
exports of products to customers in China. The license process for e xports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions
that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements  have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new 
restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive
position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the
geographic,  customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we
are unable to provide contractual warranty or othe r extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to
significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants an y requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose
burdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certa in of our competitors,
as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to
pursue alternatives  to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may aga in change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial resu lts. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively exclu ding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms t o create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions su ch as requiring chip tracking and throttling
mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has
a lready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a
significant portion of our supply and dis tribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export co ntrols may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to
those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our product s, which are warehoused in and distributed
from Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in serve rs
containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large cluster s for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competit ors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions t o “design-out” certain
U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or
shifting export contr ols have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our
competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our busin ess, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls
may negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets , such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is  ready for
market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,
which would be less likely t o be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and i ncreased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or  any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the
Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products mad e by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another
example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per
memory  bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way
that effectively prevents us from being able to de sign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center
products and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating result s and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the
products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
39Finally , our business depends on our abi lity to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or serv ices from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.

1. General.
(a )Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation
1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 199 8 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation
2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Followi ng the
Effective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the
terms of this Plan except as follows: from the  Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company
anticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Empl oyees, Directors or Consultants who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan
covering up to an aggrega te of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign
nationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Fo reign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all
of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that
t he issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of
shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards grant ed following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign
Transition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for  issuance under this Plan as
provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that
expire or terminate for any reaso n prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for
issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in th is Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted
under the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
(b)Eligible Award Re cipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (i i) Nonstatutory Stock Options,
(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance
Cash Awards, and (viii)  Other Stock Awards.(d)Purpose. The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive
Awards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide i ncentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any
Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit fr om increases in value of the Common
Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to  “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant
to the transition relief provided by the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in
effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by  the Board, in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.
2. Administration.
(a)Administration by Board.  The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b)Powers of Board. The Board will have th e power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (B)  when and how each
Award will be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not
be identical), including the time or t imes when a person will be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; (E) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and (F) the Fair Ma rket Value applicable to a Stock Award.
(ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its
administration. The Board,  in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award
Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to th e extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the
Plan or Award fully effective.
(iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iv) To accelerate the time at  which an Award may be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it m ay be exercised or the time during which it
will vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Plan to the c ontrary, the time at which a Participant’s Award may be exercised or the time during which a Participant’s Award or any part thereof
will vest may only be accelerated in the event of the Participant’s  death or Disability or in the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement,  suspension or
termination of the Plan will not materially impair a Participant’s rights under his or her then-outstanding Award without his or her written consent.
(vi) To amend the Plan in any respec t the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive
Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bri ng the Plan or Awards granted under
the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section 9(a) relating to
Capitalization Ad justments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) mat erially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at w hich shares of Common
Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) materially expands the types of Awards
available for issuance under the Plan , but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
the Plan or an AwardAgreement, rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan  will not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless
(i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing.
(vii) To submit any  amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereu nder regarding the exclusion of performance-based
compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding
Incentive Sto ck Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
(viii) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including,
but not limited to, amendments to provi de terms more favorable than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits
in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided however, that, except with respe ct to amendments that disqualify or impair the
status of an Incentive Stock Option or as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, the rights under any Award will not be
materially impaire d by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant
consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitation s of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participant’s
consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary (A) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as a n
Incentive Stock Option, (B) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
the related guidance thereunder, or (C) to comply with o ther applicable laws.
(ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best
interests of the Company and that are not in confli ct with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
(x) To adopt such procedures or terms and sub-plans (none of which will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan) as are
necessary or desirable to  permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or
employed or located outside the United States.
(c)Delegation to Committee.
(i) Genera l. The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration
of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection  with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore
possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of
 the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee
or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions,  not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by
the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan  with the Committee and may, at
any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.
(ii) Section 162(m) and Rule 16b-3 Compliance. The Committee may consist solely of two or  more Outside Directors, in
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3. In addition, the
Board or the Committee, in its s ole discretion, may (A) delegate to a Committee who need not be Outside Directors the authority to grant Awards
to eligible persons who are either (I) not then Covered Employees and are not expected t o be Covered Employees at the time of recognition of
income resulting from such Stock Award, or (II) not persons with respect to whom the Company wishes to comply with Section 162(m) of the
Code, and/ or (B) delegate to a Committee who need not be Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Stock Awards to eligible persons who
are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
(d)Delegation  to Other Person or Body. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more persons or bodies the authority to do
one or more of the following to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) design ate recipients, other than Officers, of Stock Awards, provided that
no person or body may be delegated authority to grant a Stock Award to themself; (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock  subject
to such Stock Awards; and(iii) determine the terms of such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Board or Committee action regarding such delegation will fix the
terms of such delegation  in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation Sections 152 and 157 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Unless provided otherwise in the Board or Committee action regarding such  delegation, each Stock Award granted pursuant to
this section will be granted on the applicable form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee,
with any mod ifications necessary to incorporate or reflect the terms of such Stock Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2(d), neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to any per son or body (who is not a Director or that is not comprised solely of Directors,
respectively) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 13(x)(iii) below.
(e)Effect of Board ’s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(f)Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards. Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise
or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation  Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancel any outstanding Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash o r other Stock
Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.
(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Divide nds or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the applicable Award Agr eement; provided,
however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested
under the terms of such Award Agreement, (i i) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of such Award Ag reement (including, but not limited to, any
vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to the
Company on t he date, if any, such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to meet any vesting conditions under
the terms of such Award Agreement.
3.Shares Subject to the Plan.
(a)Sh are Reserve. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards  after the Effective Date will not exceed 10,289,710,640 shares
(the “2007 Plan Reserve”). Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) 152,767,766 shares, which is the total
re serve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the
shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans on t he Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000
shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Mee ting of
Stockholders), (iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 shares that
were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting o f Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockho lders, (vii)
733,103,298 shares that were added to reflect a 4-for-1 stock split effective July 19, 2021, (viii) 51,500,000 shares that were approved at the
Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholde rs, and (ix) 9,260,739,576 shares that were added to reflect a 10-for-1 stock split effective June
7, 2024. For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number of sha res of Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a). Shares may
be issued in conn ection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule,  and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares
available for issuance under the Plan.
 The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 s tock split effective September 10, 2007.1
1(b)Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve.
(i) Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise te rminate, in
whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at thei r original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Company’s reacquisition or repurchase
rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or  condition required for the vesting of
such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or
repurchased by the Comp any, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participan t
because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award (including any shares subject to a
Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant beca use the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock
Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in s hares of Common Stock, the
number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under
the Plan. If any shares subjec t to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in
satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number  of shares that are not delivered to the Participant
shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise or purchase price of any Stock Award, or the withholding of
taxes  incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual
delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered s hall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares
of Common Stock are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of  a Stock Award,
then the number of shares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(c)Incentive Stock Option Limit. Subject to the 2007 Plan Reserve and the pr ovisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options under the  Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) will be 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
(d)Individual Award Limitations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relati ng to Capitalization Adjustments, no Participant will be
eligible to be granted during any fiscal year:
(i) Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by refer ence to an increase over an
exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more
than 80,000,000 shares of Comm on Stock;
(ii) Performance Stock Awards covering more than 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and
(iii) Performance Cash Awards with a value of more than $6,000,000.
If a Performance Stock Award is in  the form of an Option, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award limit. If a Performance
Stock Award could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award lim it.
(e)Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including
shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or other wise.
4.Eligibility.
(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a “parent
corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as  such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than
Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, that Stoc k Awards may not be granted to
Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Rule 405 of the SecuritiesAct,  unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under Section 409A of the Code (for example,
because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate tran saction such as a spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in connection with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) the  Company, in
connection with its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent S tockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such
Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Optio n is not exercisable after the
expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c)Consultants. A Consultant will be eligible for the grant of an Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Re gistration Statement
under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (“Form S-8”) is available to register either the offer or the sale of
the Company’s securities to  such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the
Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of For m S-8.
5.Provisions Relating to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board will deem appropriate. All Option s will be
separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate
certificate or certificates will be issued for s hares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically
designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option  but some portion or all of the Option fails to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The
provision s of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Agreement will include (through incorporation
of provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherw ise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the
expiratio n of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement (the “Expiration Date”).
(b)Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding T en Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the
Award Agreement to the contrary, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value subject to  the
Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike
price lower than the Fair Market Value subject to the Awar d if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option
or stock appreciation right in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A and, if applicable, Secti on 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.
(c)Consideration. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be p aid, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.
The Board will have the authority to  grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to
use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to uti lize a particular method of payment. The methods of
payment permitted by this Section 5(c) are:
(i) by cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer payable to the Company;
(ii) pu rsuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance
of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or c heck) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay
the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;(iii) if an option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a “net  exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not 
exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent
of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise pric e not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided,
further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable t hereafter to the extent that (A)
shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as
a result of such exe rcise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Ag reement.
(d)Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the
Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Apprec iation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution
payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value  (on the date of
the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is
vested under such SAR, and with respect to w hich the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price. The appreciation
distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other fo rm of consideration, as determined by the
Board and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.
(e)Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such lim itations on the transferability of Options
and SARs as the Board will determine. If the Board determines that an Option or SAR will be transferable, the Option or SAR will contain such
additional term s and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the
following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or
pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below) and will be exercisa ble during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner consistent with appl icable tax and securities
laws upon the Participant’s request. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.
(ii) Domestic Relations Orders. N otwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or official marital settleme nt agreement; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoi ng, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a
Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company (o r the designated
broker), designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and
receive the Common Stock or other con sideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or
administrator of the Participant’s estate (or other party legally entitled to the Option or SAR proceeds)  will be entitled to exercise the Option or
SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a
beneficiary at any  time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of
applicable laws or difficult to administer.
(f)Vesting Generally. The total numb er of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become
exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other  terms and conditions on the
time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board
may deem appropriate. The ve sting provisions ofindividual Options or SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then the  Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service.
The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing th e minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to
which an Option or SAR may be exercised.
(g)Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other  agreement between
the Participant and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant’s
death or Disability), the Participant  may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award
as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time  ending on the earlier of (i) the date 90 days following the
termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agree ment. If,
after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the
Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or  SAR will terminate.
(h)Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service
(other than for Cause or upon the Participan t’s death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of
Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the  Participant to short-swing liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act due to a transaction engaged in by the Participant prior to his or her termination of Continuous Service, then
the Option o r SAR will terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of 90 days after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous
Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not  be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the
Participant to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Optio n or SAR as set forth in
the Award Agreement. All determinations under this Section 5(h) will be made in the sole discretion of the Board.
(i)Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in  the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant
and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s Disability,  the Participant may
exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service), but only wi thin such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous
Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the A ward Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service,
the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the  Option
or SAR will terminate.
(j)Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and
the Company, in the event that (i)  a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s death (which termination event
will give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), or (ii) the  Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the
Award Agreement after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event will not give ris e to
acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled
to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of d eath) by the Participant’s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or
SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participa nt’s death, but only within the period
ending on the earlier of (A) the date 18 months following the date of death, or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in
the Award Ag reement. If, after the Participant’s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR will terminate.
(k)Terminat ion for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant’s Award Agreement, or other individual written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Particip ant’s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or
SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant’s termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will be prohibited from ex ercising
his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.(l)Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for p urposes of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of
grant of the Option or SAR (al though the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Corporat e Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed,
continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the
Parti cipant’s Award Agreement or in another agreement between the Participant and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with
the Company’s then current employment policies and guidelines),  the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six
(6) months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non- exempt employee in
connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or
required for compliance with the Worke r Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection
with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from  the employee’s regular rate of pay, the
provisions of this Section 5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.
6.Provisions of Stock  Awards other than Options and SARs.
(a)Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as
the Board will deem appropriat e. To the extent consistent with the Company’s Bylaws, at the Board’s election, shares of Common Stock may be
(x) held in book entry form subject to the Company’s instructions until any restrictions r elating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or
(y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of
Restricte d Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award
Agreements need not be identical, provided, however, that each Restricted Stock A ward Agreement will include (through incorporation of the
provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(i) Consideration. A Re stricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft, money order or
electronic funds transfer payable to the Company, (B) past services rendered to the Company or an A ffiliate, or (C) any other form of legal
consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. Shar es of Common Stock awarded under a Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the
Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board; provided, however,  that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s
Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Award will become fully vested as of the date of
termination of  Continuous Service.
(iii) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates, the Company
may receive via a forfeiture condition or a repurcha se right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not
vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreem ent.
(iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by
the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set fo rth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board will determine in its
sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms  of the Restricted
Stock Award Agreement.
(b)Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will  deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to
time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need  not be identical, provided, however, that each
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement willinclude (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the s ubstance of each of the following
provisions:
(i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be
paid by the Participan t upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if
any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricte d Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration
that may be acceptable to the Board in its sole discretion and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. At the time of the gran t of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions or conditions to the
vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate; provided, h owever, that in all cases, in the event a
Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Unit Award will become fully vested as of
the date of t ermination of Continuous Service.
(iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any
combination thereof or in any other  form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreement.
(iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, t he Board, as it deems appropriate, may
impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted
Stock Unit Award  to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.
(v) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreeme nt, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant’s termination of Continuous
Service.
(c)Performance Awards.
(i) Performance Stock Awards.  A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest
or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals.  A Performance Stock Award may
require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his
or her death, then the P erformance Stock Award will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of the target level of performance, will be fully
vested, as of the date of death, and shares thereunder will be issued promptly follo wing the date of death. The length of any Performance
Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such
Performance Goals h ave been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to the extent that an Award is not intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the  Board), in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that cash may be
us ed in payment of Performance Stock Awards.
(ii) Performance Cash Awards. A Performance Cash Award is a cash award that is payable contingent upon the attainment during
a Performance Period of certain  Performance Goals. A Performance Cash Award may also require the completion of a specified period of
Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved duri ng the Performance Period, and the
measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to
the extent that an Award is  not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board), in its
sole discretion. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may provide for or, subject  to such terms and conditions as the Board or the
Committee, as applicable, may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Cash Award to be deferred to a
specified  date or event. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may specify the form of payment of Performance Cash Awards, which may
be cash or other property, or may provide for a Participant to have the  option for his or her Performance Cash Award, or such portion thereof as
the Board or theCommittee, as applicable, may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, t o the extent permitted by applicable
law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that Common Stock authorized under this
Plan may be used in paymen t of Performance Cash Awards, including additional shares in excess of the Performance Cash Award as an
inducement to hold shares of Common Stock.
(iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise per mitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code
with respect to any Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” thereunder, the Committee will establish the  Performance
Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after
the commencement of the applicable Performa nce Period, and (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in any
event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Pr ior to the payment of any
compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will
certify the extent to which any Perfo rmance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases
where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). With respect to any Awar d intended to qualify as “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due
upon the attainment of the a pplicable Performance Goals on the basis of any such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine.
(d)Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole  or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock,
including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and  the
preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including, but not limited to, Section 2(g)), the Board will have sole
and complete authority to determine the perso ns to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number
of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awar ds and all other terms and
conditions of such Other Stock Awards; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then  any Other Stock Awards held by such Participant will become fully vested as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service.
7.Covenants of the Company.
(a)Availability of Shares. During the terms o f the Stock Awards, the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of
Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
(b)Securities Law Compliance. The Company will s eek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the
Plan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue an d sell shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities
Act the Plan, any Stock Award or  any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if
the cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the ben efits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such
regulator y commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common
Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for f ailure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock
Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent iss uance of cash
or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.
(c)No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company will ha ve no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant
as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or othe rwise advise
such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has any duty or  obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award.8.Miscellaneous.
(a)Use of Proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will consti tute general funds of the Company.
(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed  as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually receiv ed or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
 exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate reco rds will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to ha ve any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
o f shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Se rvice Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any rig ht to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment  of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pur suant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisi ons of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commit ment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has  a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance wi th applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date o f such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the  Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the  time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds  $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according  to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option
Agree ment(s) or any Board or Committee resolutions related thereto.
(g)Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any
Award,  (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably sat isfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial
and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the me rits and risks of
exercising the Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock
subject to the Award for the Participant’ s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwisedistributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inope rative if (A)
the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award has been registered under a then currently
effective registration statement under the Securiti es Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws . The Company may, upon
advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with applicable se curities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.
(h)Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, i n its sole discretion, satisfy any
federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award (including but not limited to income tax, social insurance
contributions, payment on  account or any other taxes) by any of the following means (in addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate) or by a combina tion of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a
cash payment; (ii)  withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in
co nnection with the Award; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of
tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be  necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts  otherwise payable to the
Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.
(i)Electronic Delivery. Any reference herein to a “written” agreement or document will inc lude any agreement or document delivered
electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company’s intranet.
(j)Deferrals. To the extent permitted by  applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock
or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may  be deferred and may establish programs
and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code. Consistent  with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise
providing services to the Company or an Affiliate. The Board is authorized  to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual
percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant’s termination of Continuous S ervice,
and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.
(k)Compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly prov ided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will
be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 4 09A of
the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted
hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to  Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will
incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to th e extent an
Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan  (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common
Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” und er Section 409A of the Code is a
“specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation
from service” (as defined  in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date
that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation fro m service” or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless
such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred wil l be paid in
a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.(l)Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be su bject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the
Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Compa ny’s
securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In
addition, the Board may impose such other clawback,  recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines
necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of  Common Stock or other
cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause.
9.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Other Corporate Events.
(a)Capitalization Adjustments. In the event of a Capitalizatio n Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the
class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and maximum n umber of securities
that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section 3(c); (iii) the class(es) and maximum number of
securities that may be awarded to any per son pursuant to Section 3(d); and (iv) the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of
stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments, and its determinat ion will be final, binding and conclusive.
(b)Dissolution or Liquidation. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of
the Company, and up on ten (10) days prior written notice, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and
outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchas e or a forfeiture condition) will terminate immediately prior
to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company’s repurchase rights or a forfe iture
condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing
Continuous Service, provided, however, that the Board may, in  its sole discretion, cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested,
exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expire d or terminated)
before the dissolution or liquidation is completed but contingent on its completion.
(c)Corporate Transaction.
(i) Stock Awards May Be Assumed. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock  Award Agreement, in the event of a Corporate
Transaction, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation’s parent company) may assume or
continue any or  all Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or may substitute similar stock awards for Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan
(including but not limited to, awards to acquire the same consideration  paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Corporate
Transaction), and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Common Stock issued pursuant to Stock Award s
may be assigned by the Company to the successor of the Company (or the successor’s parent company, if any), in connection with such
Corporate Transaction. A surviving corporation or acquiring corpor ation (or its parent) may choose to assume or continue only a portion of a
Stock Award or substitute a similar stock award for only a portion of a Stock Award.
(ii) Stock Awards Not Assumed Held by Cu rrent Participants. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock Award Agreement
(including an option and stock award agreement subject to the terms of the Prior Plans, which terms remain applicable as to  outstanding options
and stock awards thereunder), in the event of a Corporate Transaction in which the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or its parent
company) does not assume or continu e any or all outstanding Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards for such outstanding Stock
Awards, then with respect to Stock Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and t hat are held by Participants whose
Continuous Service has not terminated prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction (referred to as the “Current Participants”), the
vesting of such Stock  Awards (and, if applicable, the time at which such Stock Awards may be exercised) will (contingent upon the effectiveness
of the Corporate Transaction) be accelerated in full to a date prior to the e ffective time of such Corporate Transaction as the Board will determine
(or, if the Board will not determine such a date, to the date that is five business (5) days prior to the effective time of the  Corporate Transaction),
and such StockAwards will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, and any reacquisition or
repurchase rights  held by the Company with respect to such Stock Awards will lapse (contingent upon the effectiveness of the Corporate
Transaction).
(iii) Stock Awards Not Assumed Held by Persons other than Current Par ticipants. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock
Award Agreement (including an option and stock award agreement subject to the terms of the Prior Plans, which terms remain applicable as to
outstandi ng options and stock awards thereunder), in the event of a Corporate Transaction in which the surviving corporation or acquiring
corporation (or its parent company) does not assume or continue any or  all outstanding Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards for such
outstanding Stock Awards, then with respect to Stock Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and that are h eld by
persons other than Current Participants, the vesting of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time at which such Stock Award may be
exercised) will not be accelerated and such Stock Awards  (other than a Stock Award consisting of vested and outstanding shares of Common
Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchase), upon advance written notice by the Company of at least five (5 ) business days to the
holders of such Stock Awards, will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction; provided,
however, that any reacquisition  or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to such Stock Awards will not terminate and may
continue to be exercised notwithstanding the Corporate Transaction.
(d)Change in Control.
(i) Sto ck Awards May Be Assumed. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a Change in
Control, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquirin g corporation’s parent company) may assume or continue
any or all Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or may substitute similar stock awards for Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan
(including  but not limited to, awards to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Change in
Control), and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company  in respect of Common Stock issued pursuant to Stock Awards may be
assigned by the Company to the successor of the Company (or the successor’s parent company, if any), in connection with such Change in 
Control. A surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or its parent) may choose to assume or continue only a portion of a Stock Award or
substitute a similar stock award for only a portion of a  Stock Award.
(ii) Stock Awards Not Assumed Held by Current Participants. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock Award Agreement
(including an option and stock award agreement subject to the terms of  the Prior Plans, which terms remain applicable as to outstanding options
and stock awards thereunder), in the event of a Change in Control in which the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation ( or its parent
company) does not assume or continue any or all outstanding Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards for such outstanding Stock
Awards, then with respect to Stock Awards that have  not been assumed, continued or substituted and that are held by Current Participants, the
vesting of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time at which such Stock Awards may be exercised) will  (contingent upon the effectiveness
of the Change in Control) be accelerated in full to a date prior to the effective time of such Change in Control as the Board will determine (or, if
the Board will n ot determine such a date, to the date that is five business (5) days prior to the effective time of the Change in Control), and such
Stock Awards will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or  prior to the effective time of the Change in Control, and any reacquisition or
repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to such Stock Awards will lapse (contingent upon the effectiveness of  the Change in

(iii) Stock Awards Not Assumed Held by Persons other than Current Participants. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock
Award Agreement (including an option and stock award agr eement subject to the terms of the Prior Plans, which terms remain applicable as to
outstanding options and stock awards thereunder), in the event of a Change in Control in which the surviving corpora tion or acquiring
corporation (or its parent company) does not assume or continue any or all outstanding Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards for such
outstanding Stock Awards, then with re spect to Stock Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and that are held by
persons other than Current Participants, the vesting of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time  at which such Stock Award may be
exercised) will not be accelerated and such Stock Awards (other than a Stock Award consisting of vestedand outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to the Compan y’s right of repurchase), upon advance written notice by the Company of at
least five (5) business days to the holders of such Stock Awards, will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) prior to th e effective time of the
Change in Control; provided, however, that any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to such Stock Awards will
not terminate and may continue to b e exercised notwithstanding the Change in Control.
(iv) Additional Provisions. A Stock Award may be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and exercisability upon or after a
Change in Control a s may be provided in the Stock Award Agreement for such Stock Award or as may be provided in any other written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant. A Stock Award may ves t as to all or any portion of the shares subject to the
Stock Award (i) immediately upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, whether or not such Stock Award is assumed, continued, or substituted
by  a surviving or acquiring entity in the Change in Control, and/or (ii) in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service is terminated, actually or
constructively, within a designated period following t he occurrence of a Change in Control, but in the absence of such provision, no such
acceleration will occur.

Participant as an Employee, Officer, Director or Consultant of the Company or an Affiliate, other than as a result of having a Disability, or a
breach  of any applicable invention assignment and confidentiality agreement or similar agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the
Participant, (D) the Participant’s disregard of the policies of th e Company or an Affiliate so as to cause loss, damage or injury to the property,
reputation or employees of the Company or an Affiliate, or (E) any other misconduct by the Participant that is material ly injurious to the financial
condition or business reputation of, or is otherwise materially injurious to, the Company or an Affiliate.
(g) “Change in Control” means the occurrence, in a single trans action or in a series of related transactions, of any one or more of the
following events:
(i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company represent ing more than 50%
of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Cha nge in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by
an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Compa ny’s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, or (B) solely because
 the level of Ownership held by any Exchange Act Person (the “Subject Person”) exceeds the designated percentage threshold of the
outstanding voting securities as a result of a repurchase or other acqu isition of voting securities by the Company reducing the number of shares
outstanding, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acqu isition of voting
securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition, the Subject Person becomes the Owner of any additional voting securities that,
assuming the repurchase or other acquisiti on had not occurred, increases the percentage of the then outstanding voting securities Owned by the
Subject Person over the designated percentage threshold, then a Change in Control will be deemed to  occur;
(ii) there is consummated a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving (directly or indirectly) the Company and,
immediately after the consummation of such merger, consolidation or  similar transaction, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
thereto do not Own, directly or indirectly, either (A) outstanding voting securities representing more than 50% of the combined  outstanding voting
power of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction or (B) more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power
of the parent of the surviving Entit y in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as
their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to s uch transaction;
(iii) there is consummated a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than  a sale, lease, license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to an Entity, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the  voting securities of which are Owned by
stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company
immediately prior to su ch sale, lease, license or other disposition; or
(iv) individuals who, on the date this Plan is adopted by the Board, are members of the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for
any reason to constitut e at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the appointment or election (or nomination for
election) of any new Board member was approved orrecommended by a majority  vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered as a member of the Incumbent Board.
For purposes of determining voting p ower under the term Change in Control, voting power will be calculated by assuming the conversion of
all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote , but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or
right to subscribe to or purchase those shares. In addition, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other
transac tion effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any
analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Co mpany or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing
definition with respect to Awards subject to such agreement; provided, however, that if no definition of Change in Control or an y analogous term
is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply; provided, further, that no Change in Control will be deemed
to occur upon announcement or co mmencement of a tender offer or upon a potential takeover or upon stockholder approval of a merger or other
transaction, in each case without a requirement that the Change in Control actually occur.
I f required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such
transaction is not also a “change in the ownership or effective control  of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of
the assets of” the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative  definition
thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s consent, amend the definition of “Change in Control” to conform to
the definition of “Change in Control” under  Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(h)“Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.
(i)“Committee” me ans a committee of one (1) or more Directors to whom authority has been delegated by the Board in accordance with
Section 2(c).
(j)“Common Stock” means the common stock of the Company.

Compute & Networking revenue – The increa se in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2024 was due to strengt h in Data Center computing and networking for accelerat ed computing and AI solutions. Revenue from GPU computing grew 166% year-
on-year and 257% compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU architecture computin g platform for training and
inferencing of large language models, recomm endation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was also up 114% year-on-year and 159%
compared to the first half  of last year driven by both InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue.
28Graphics revenue  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first  half of fiscal year 2024 was led
by higher sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compa red to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2024 in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.
All Other operating loss – The incre ase in the second  quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024
was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and c ompensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises  and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal year 2025, r espectively , and 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively .
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct cus tomers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integ rators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal re sources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service provide rs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Comp ute & Networking segment, are
presented in the following table:
 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended
 Jul 28, 2024 Jul 28, 2024
Customer A 14 % 14 %
Customer B 11 % *
Customer C 11 % *
Customer D 10 %  10 %
Customer E * 10 %
* Less than 10% of total revenue
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distrib utors, including
through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represent 10% or more of total revenue attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
For the first half of fiscal year 202 5, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products from system integrators and distributors, including from
Customer E, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable  to the Compute & Networking segment.
Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data
 and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may dif fer from our estimates.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,  and this trend may continue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.
Our overall gross margi n increased to 75.1% and 76.6% for the second quart er and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , from 70.1% and 68.2% for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The increases in the second quarter and first half  of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 154% and 234% for the second quarter and first half of
 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively ,  and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 millio n and $199 million for the second quarter  and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively . The net effect on
our
29gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $576 million and $709 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal  year 2024,
respectively . Sales of previously reserved invent ory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $84 million and
$134 million  for the seco nd quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 3.6% and
2.8% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, re spectively .
We expect our Data Center mix to continue to shift to new products in the second half of fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in
the mid-70% range.

The increas es in interest income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 was due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and publicly-held debt
secu rity balances.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other , net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in  privately-held equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact
of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other , net, compared to the second quarter and first half of fis cal year 2024 was primarily driven by an
increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statem ents in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity

30Income T axes
We recognized i ncome tax expense of $2.6 billion and $5.0 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and $793 million and
$958 million for the second quarter and first half of  fiscal year 2024, respectively . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.6%
and 13.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and 11.4%  and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,
respectively .
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intang ible income deduction relative to the increase
in income before income tax.
Given our current and anticipated future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation  allowance associated with c ertain state deferred tax assets in
the near term, which would decrease our income  tax expense for the period the release is recor ded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release
could  vary based on our assessment of all available evidence.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (8, 877) $ (1,287)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,665) $ (5,479)
Our investm ent policy requires the purchase of high-rated fixed income securities, the diversi fication of investment types a nd credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024  due to growth in revenue, partially
offset by higher tax paym ents. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2025 reflects the strong revenue growth, partially offse t
by $2.8 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal  year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of
marketable securities, and acquisition of land and buildings.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared  to the first half of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 28, 2024, we
had $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liqui dity to meet our operating requirements for at least
the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our  liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-he ld equity securities,  debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by hig hly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt
securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Co nsolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
31Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable se curities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities held outside the U.S.
as of July 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Payment from customers, per our standard paym ent term s, is generally due shortly after delivery  of products, availability of software licenses or commencement
of services.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the second quarter and first half of fisca l year 2025, we paid $246 million and $344 million, respectively , in quarterly cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our  Board of Directors' continuing determination that the
dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On June 7, 2024, we increased our qua rterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024. Our
quarterly cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024.
During the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and
$15.1 billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were authorized, su bject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock. On
August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approve d an additional $50.0 billion to our share repurchase authoriz ation, without expiration. As of August 26, 2024, a
total of $53.9 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while main taining
adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment
opportunities. W e plan to continue share repu rchases this fiscal year .
From April 29, 2024 through August 26, 2024, we repurchased 31.5 million shares for $3.6 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The U.S. Inflation Reduc tion Act of  2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost a nd was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $186 million recorded in non-current income tax p ayable as of
July 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability , interest payme nts, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the
underlying income tax  positions and the timing of
32the ef fective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the cont ractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations
from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for th e fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report o n Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of July 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
i nformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and f orms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions reg arding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or ar e reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update  much of
our existing core financia l systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will
occur in phases. W e will cont inue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ  ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control sys tem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must re flect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation o f controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Pa rt I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “L egal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk facto rs liste d below , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A  of our  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA  common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Ite m 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024, and below . Any
one of  those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends  and uncertainties not present ly known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
Long manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply an d component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,
has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and asse mb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component
or capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a  quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in  both product shortages and
excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advanc e of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments f or capacity to address our business needs, or our
long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary fo r the
finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited  supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 m onths. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scal e their capabilities to meet
our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply
commitments at th e same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our pr oducts,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
 •competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•changes in business and economic conditions;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues ;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting  in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end-use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products;
•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated computing,  AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
34•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products; or
•government a ctions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
We continue to increase our supply and capacit y purchases with existing and new supplier s to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have
also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.  The increased purchase
volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with
variations in productio n planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to
increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incu r inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments
exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may cha nge or may not be correct, as we have
experienced in the past.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare  to ship and support
new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.
The computing industr y is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center arc hitectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year
and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the la rger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating
product transi tions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in
our revenue . We have experienced and may in the fut ure experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate
transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and f uture architecture transitions. If we are unable to
execute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and comp lexity of
newly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other
costs or result in produc t delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory pro visions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the
future.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product road map may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may  not be
able to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple pro duct archit ectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customer s often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through
multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by o ur multiple OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have
impacted and c ould in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various
downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers'  future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely  basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be
able to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient sup ply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill
our custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputa tion
could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any
one component have had and may  have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able  to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have imple mented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a  result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and rec orded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of
our historical  lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of
35these impac ts has increased and may continue  to increase as our purchase obligations an d prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and
become a greater portion of our total supply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Demand  estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to
generate significant revenue from them. Recent   technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for
Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multi ple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with
any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
Challenges  in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natur al disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,  contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed a nd marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future
impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, se veral years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to
be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact  of
cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price change s in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in
the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the futu re impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further
impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not  limited to, the Ethereum 2.0
merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sale s of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or
previously sold products may be resold online or on the unau thorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and
reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.
Additionally , we depend  on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publi shers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by
developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our p latforms, or failure by third-party content providers
or publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adverse ly affect
customer demand.
We receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to
customers who purchase directly or  indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of
these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited numb er of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to direct Customers, A, B,
C and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal  year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to
the Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio throug h their
channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. We have a small number of  partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly
complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key custome rs. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their
ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to custome rs. In the future, these
partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.
Because most of  our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little
notice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or custome rs may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and
our partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our pr oducts, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’
purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,  distributors
and other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators
and distributors, includin g through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &
Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supp ly availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors
and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amoun t of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them,
36our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to whic h our business is subject, and political and other actions may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas inclu ding, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; impor t and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreig n exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; data priva cy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and s afety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,  and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to
manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not  violate applicable laws
or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions
against us,  our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations
to which we are subject, or changes to their inte rpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For  example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result
of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity v ulnerabilities and risks.
Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,
the United Ki ngdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Author ity collected information from us regarding our business and
competition in the graph ics card and cloud service provider marke t as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received
requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, a nd South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs,
our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions
on the hardw are, software, and system s used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June
2024 and will be implemented in phases betwee n now and 2030. The State of Calif ornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions
under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, d elay or halt deployment of new systems
using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or
regulation s or their interpretation and enforceme nt could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or  exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our
shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in  the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our
business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security polic ies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sa nctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with  entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligation s and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation oc curred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial co ndition.
For example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, s ervices and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukr aine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that ta rget products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.
Concerns regardin g third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the f uture result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and c ould in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our busines s and financial results.
37Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.
As ge opolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export
control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in t he U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to Chi na, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively a nd materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be furthe r tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvanta ge for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream use rs of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our  cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end custom ers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gam ing products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less  likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impactin g our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial  results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to inclu de deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restric tions may not only impact our ability to serve
overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide  our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our
sales and efforts to supply the China m arket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators
conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any app licable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions
on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating  results and financial condition.
During the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and
supercompu ting industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including  Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing r equirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circu its. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second qu arter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countr ies in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Group s D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A80 0, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate par ent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H80 0, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validatio n, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distri bution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for
which the USG does not require a  license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing
requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing  process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a
license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved,  it may impose burdensome conditions that
we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that
38does not have clear standard s or an opportunity  for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for
exports of products to customers in China. The license process for e xports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions
that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements  have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new 
restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive
position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the
geographic,  customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we
are unable to provide contractual warranty or othe r extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to
significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants an y requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose
burdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certa in of our competitors,
as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to
pursue alternatives  to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may aga in change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial resu lts. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively exclu ding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms t o create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions su ch as requiring chip tracking and throttling
mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has
a lready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a
significant portion of our supply and dis tribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export co ntrols may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to
those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our product s, which are warehoused in and distributed
from Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in serve rs
containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large cluster s for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competit ors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions t o “design-out” certain
U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or
shifting export contr ols have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our
competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our busin ess, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls
may negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets , such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is  ready for
market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,
which would be less likely t o be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and i ncreased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or  any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the
Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products mad e by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another
example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per
memory  bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way
that effectively prevents us from being able to de sign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center
products and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating result s and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the
products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
39Finally , our business depends on our abi lity to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or serv ices from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.

1. General.
(a )Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation
1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 199 8 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation
2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Followi ng the
Effective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the
terms of this Plan except as follows: from the  Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company
anticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Empl oyees, Directors or Consultants who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan
covering up to an aggrega te of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign
nationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Fo reign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all
of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that
t he issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of
shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards grant ed following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign
Transition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for  issuance under this Plan as
provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that
expire or terminate for any reaso n prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for
issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in th is Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted
under the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
(b)Eligible Award Re cipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (i i) Nonstatutory Stock Options,
(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance
Cash Awards, and (viii)  Other Stock Awards.(d)Purpose. The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive
Awards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide i ncentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any
Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit fr om increases in value of the Common
Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to  “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant
to the transition relief provided by the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in
effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by  the Board, in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.
2. Administration.
(a)Administration by Board.  The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b)Powers of Board. The Board will have th e power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (B)  when and how each
Award will be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not
be identical), including the time or t imes when a person will be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; (E) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and (F) the Fair Ma rket Value applicable to a Stock Award.
(ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its
administration. The Board,  in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award
Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to th e extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the
Plan or Award fully effective.
(iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iv) To accelerate the time at  which an Award may be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it m ay be exercised or the time during which it
will vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Plan to the c ontrary, the time at which a Participant’s Award may be exercised or the time during which a Participant’s Award or any part thereof
will vest may only be accelerated in the event of the Participant’s  death or Disability or in the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement,  suspension or
termination of the Plan will not materially impair a Participant’s rights under his or her then-outstanding Award without his or her written consent.
(vi) To amend the Plan in any respec t the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive
Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bri ng the Plan or Awards granted under
the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section 9(a) relating to
Capitalization Ad justments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) mat erially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at w hich shares of Common
Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) materially expands the types of Awards
available for issuance under the Plan , but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
the Plan or an AwardAgreement, rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan  will not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless
(i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing.
(vii) To submit any  amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereu nder regarding the exclusion of performance-based
compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding
Incentive Sto ck Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
(viii) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including,
but not limited to, amendments to provi de terms more favorable than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits
in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided however, that, except with respe ct to amendments that disqualify or impair the
status of an Incentive Stock Option or as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, the rights under any Award will not be
materially impaire d by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant
consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitation s of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participant’s
consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary (A) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as a n
Incentive Stock Option, (B) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
the related guidance thereunder, or (C) to comply with o ther applicable laws.
(ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best
interests of the Company and that are not in confli ct with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
(x) To adopt such procedures or terms and sub-plans (none of which will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan) as are
necessary or desirable to  permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or
employed or located outside the United States.
(c)Delegation to Committee.
(i) Genera l. The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration
of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection  with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore
possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of
 the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee
or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions,  not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by
the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan  with the Committee and may, at
any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.
(ii) Section 162(m) and Rule 16b-3 Compliance. The Committee may consist solely of two or  more Outside Directors, in
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3. In addition, the
Board or the Committee, in its s ole discretion, may (A) delegate to a Committee who need not be Outside Directors the authority to grant Awards
to eligible persons who are either (I) not then Covered Employees and are not expected t o be Covered Employees at the time of recognition of
income resulting from such Stock Award, or (II) not persons with respect to whom the Company wishes to comply with Section 162(m) of the
Code, and/ or (B) delegate to a Committee who need not be Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Stock Awards to eligible persons who
are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
(d)Delegation  to Other Person or Body. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more persons or bodies the authority to do
one or more of the following to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) design ate recipients, other than Officers, of Stock Awards, provided that
no person or body may be delegated authority to grant a Stock Award to themself; (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock  subject
to such Stock Awards; and(iii) determine the terms of such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Board or Committee action regarding such delegation will fix the
terms of such delegation  in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation Sections 152 and 157 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Unless provided otherwise in the Board or Committee action regarding such  delegation, each Stock Award granted pursuant to
this section will be granted on the applicable form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee,
with any mod ifications necessary to incorporate or reflect the terms of such Stock Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2(d), neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to any per son or body (who is not a Director or that is not comprised solely of Directors,
respectively) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 13(x)(iii) below.
(e)Effect of Board ’s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(f)Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards. Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise
or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation  Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancel any outstanding Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash o r other Stock
Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.
(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Divide nds or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the applicable Award Agr eement; provided,
however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested
under the terms of such Award Agreement, (i i) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of such Award Ag reement (including, but not limited to, any
vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to the
Company on t he date, if any, such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to meet any vesting conditions under
the terms of such Award Agreement.
3.Shares Subject to the Plan.
(a)Sh are Reserve. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards  after the Effective Date will not exceed 10,289,710,640 shares
(the “2007 Plan Reserve”). Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) 152,767,766 shares, which is the total
re serve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the
shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans on t he Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000
shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Mee ting of
Stockholders), (iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 shares that
were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting o f Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockho lders, (vii)
733,103,298 shares that were added to reflect a 4-for-1 stock split effective July 19, 2021, (viii) 51,500,000 shares that were approved at the
Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholde rs, and (ix) 9,260,739,576 shares that were added to reflect a 10-for-1 stock split effective June
7, 2024. For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number of sha res of Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a). Shares may
be issued in conn ection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule,  and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares
available for issuance under the Plan.
 The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 s tock split effective September 10, 2007.1
1(b)Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve.
(i) Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise te rminate, in
whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at thei r original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Company’s reacquisition or repurchase
rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or  condition required for the vesting of
such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or
repurchased by the Comp any, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participan t
because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award (including any shares subject to a
Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant beca use the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock
Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in s hares of Common Stock, the
number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under
the Plan. If any shares subjec t to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in
satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number  of shares that are not delivered to the Participant
shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise or purchase price of any Stock Award, or the withholding of
taxes  incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual
delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered s hall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares
of Common Stock are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of  a Stock Award,
then the number of shares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(c)Incentive Stock Option Limit. Subject to the 2007 Plan Reserve and the pr ovisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options under the  Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) will be 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
(d)Individual Award Limitations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relati ng to Capitalization Adjustments, no Participant will be
eligible to be granted during any fiscal year:
(i) Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by refer ence to an increase over an
exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more
than 80,000,000 shares of Comm on Stock;
(ii) Performance Stock Awards covering more than 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and
(iii) Performance Cash Awards with a value of more than $6,000,000.
If a Performance Stock Award is in  the form of an Option, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award limit. If a Performance
Stock Award could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award lim it.
(e)Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including
shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or other wise.
4.Eligibility.
(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a “parent
corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as  such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than
Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, that Stoc k Awards may not be granted to
Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Rule 405 of the SecuritiesAct,  unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under Section 409A of the Code (for example,
because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate tran saction such as a spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in connection with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) the  Company, in
connection with its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent S tockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such
Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Optio n is not exercisable after the
expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c)Consultants. A Consultant will be eligible for the grant of an Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Re gistration Statement
under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (“Form S-8”) is available to register either the offer or the sale of
the Company’s securities to  such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the
Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of For m S-8.
5.Provisions Relating to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board will deem appropriate. All Option s will be
separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate
certificate or certificates will be issued for s hares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically
designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option  but some portion or all of the Option fails to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The
provision s of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Agreement will include (through incorporation
of provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherw ise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the
expiratio n of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement (the “Expiration Date”).
(b)Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding T en Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the
Award Agreement to the contrary, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value subject to  the
Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike
price lower than the Fair Market Value subject to the Awar d if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option
or stock appreciation right in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A and, if applicable, Secti on 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.
(c)Consideration. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be p aid, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.
The Board will have the authority to  grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to
use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to uti lize a particular method of payment. The methods of
payment permitted by this Section 5(c) are:
(i) by cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer payable to the Company;
(ii) pu rsuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance
of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or c heck) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay
the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;(iii) if an option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a “net  exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not 
exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent
of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise pric e not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided,
further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable t hereafter to the extent that (A)
shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as
a result of such exe rcise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Ag reement.
(d)Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the
Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Apprec iation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution
payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value  (on the date of
the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is
vested under such SAR, and with respect to w hich the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price. The appreciation
distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other fo rm of consideration, as determined by the
Board and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.
(e)Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such lim itations on the transferability of Options
and SARs as the Board will determine. If the Board determines that an Option or SAR will be transferable, the Option or SAR will contain such
additional term s and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the
following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or
pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below) and will be exercisa ble during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner consistent with appl icable tax and securities
laws upon the Participant’s request. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.
(ii) Domestic Relations Orders. N otwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or official marital settleme nt agreement; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoi ng, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a
Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company (o r the designated
broker), designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and
receive the Common Stock or other con sideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or
administrator of the Participant’s estate (or other party legally entitled to the Option or SAR proceeds)  will be entitled to exercise the Option or
SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a
beneficiary at any  time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of
applicable laws or difficult to administer.
(f)Vesting Generally. The total numb er of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become
exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other  terms and conditions on the
time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board
may deem appropriate. The ve sting provisions ofindividual Options or SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then the  Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service.
The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing th e minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to
which an Option or SAR may be exercised.
(g)Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other  agreement between
the Participant and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant’s
death or Disability), the Participant  may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award
as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time  ending on the earlier of (i) the date 90 days following the
termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agree ment. If,
after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the
Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or  SAR will terminate.
(h)Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service
(other than for Cause or upon the Participan t’s death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of
Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the  Participant to short-swing liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act due to a transaction engaged in by the Participant prior to his or her termination of Continuous Service, then
the Option o r SAR will terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of 90 days after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous
Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not  be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the
Participant to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Optio n or SAR as set forth in
the Award Agreement. All determinations under this Section 5(h) will be made in the sole discretion of the Board.
(i)Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in  the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant
and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s Disability,  the Participant may
exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service), but only wi thin such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous
Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the A ward Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service,
the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the  Option
or SAR will terminate.
(j)Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and
the Company, in the event that (i)  a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s death (which termination event
will give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), or (ii) the  Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the
Award Agreement after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event will not give ris e to
acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled
to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of d eath) by the Participant’s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or
SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participa nt’s death, but only within the period
ending on the earlier of (A) the date 18 months following the date of death, or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in
the Award Ag reement. If, after the Participant’s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR will terminate.
(k)Terminat ion for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant’s Award Agreement, or other individual written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Particip ant’s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or
SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant’s termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will be prohibited from ex ercising
his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.(l)Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for p urposes of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of
grant of the Option or SAR (al though the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Corporat e Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed,
continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the
Parti cipant’s Award Agreement or in another agreement between the Participant and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with
the Company’s then current employment policies and guidelines),  the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six
(6) months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non- exempt employee in
connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or
required for compliance with the Worke r Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection
with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from  the employee’s regular rate of pay, the
provisions of this Section 5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.
6.Provisions of Stock  Awards other than Options and SARs.
(a)Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as
the Board will deem appropriat e. To the extent consistent with the Company’s Bylaws, at the Board’s election, shares of Common Stock may be
(x) held in book entry form subject to the Company’s instructions until any restrictions r elating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or
(y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of
Restricte d Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award
Agreements need not be identical, provided, however, that each Restricted Stock A ward Agreement will include (through incorporation of the
provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(i) Consideration. A Re stricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft, money order or
electronic funds transfer payable to the Company, (B) past services rendered to the Company or an A ffiliate, or (C) any other form of legal
consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. Shar es of Common Stock awarded under a Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the
Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board; provided, however,  that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s
Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Award will become fully vested as of the date of
termination of  Continuous Service.
(iii) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates, the Company
may receive via a forfeiture condition or a repurcha se right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not
vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreem ent.
(iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by
the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set fo rth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board will determine in its
sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms  of the Restricted
Stock Award Agreement.
(b)Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will  deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to
time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need  not be identical, provided, however, that each
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement willinclude (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the s ubstance of each of the following
provisions:
(i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be
paid by the Participan t upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if
any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricte d Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration
that may be acceptable to the Board in its sole discretion and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. At the time of the gran t of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions or conditions to the
vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate; provided, h owever, that in all cases, in the event a
Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Unit Award will become fully vested as of
the date of t ermination of Continuous Service.
(iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any
combination thereof or in any other  form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreement.
(iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, t he Board, as it deems appropriate, may
impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted
Stock Unit Award  to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.
(v) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreeme nt, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant’s termination of Continuous
Service.
(c)Performance Awards.
(i) Performance Stock Awards.  A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest
or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals.  A Performance Stock Award may
require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his
or her death, then the P erformance Stock Award will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of the target level of performance, will be fully
vested, as of the date of death, and shares thereunder will be issued promptly follo wing the date of death. The length of any Performance
Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such
Performance Goals h ave been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to the extent that an Award is not intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the  Board), in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that cash may be
us ed in payment of Performance Stock Awards.
(ii) Performance Cash Awards. A Performance Cash Award is a cash award that is payable contingent upon the attainment during
a Performance Period of certain  Performance Goals. A Performance Cash Award may also require the completion of a specified period of
Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved duri ng the Performance Period, and the
measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to
the extent that an Award is  not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board), in its
sole discretion. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may provide for or, subject  to such terms and conditions as the Board or the
Committee, as applicable, may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Cash Award to be deferred to a
specified  date or event. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may specify the form of payment of Performance Cash Awards, which may
be cash or other property, or may provide for a Participant to have the  option for his or her Performance Cash Award, or such portion thereof as
the Board or theCommittee, as applicable, may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, t o the extent permitted by applicable
law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that Common Stock authorized under this
Plan may be used in paymen t of Performance Cash Awards, including additional shares in excess of the Performance Cash Award as an
inducement to hold shares of Common Stock.
(iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise per mitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code
with respect to any Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” thereunder, the Committee will establish the  Performance
Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after
the commencement of the applicable Performa nce Period, and (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in any
event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Pr ior to the payment of any
compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will
certify the extent to which any Perfo rmance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases
where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). With respect to any Awar d intended to qualify as “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due
upon the attainment of the a pplicable Performance Goals on the basis of any such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine.
(d)Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole  or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock,
including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and  the
preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including, but not limited to, Section 2(g)), the Board will have sole
and complete authority to determine the perso ns to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number
of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awar ds and all other terms and
conditions of such Other Stock Awards; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then  any Other Stock Awards held by such Participant will become fully vested as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service.
7.Covenants of the Company.
(a)Availability of Shares. During the terms o f the Stock Awards, the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of
Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
(b)Securities Law Compliance. The Company will s eek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the
Plan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue an d sell shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities
Act the Plan, any Stock Award or  any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if
the cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the ben efits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such
regulator y commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common
Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for f ailure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock
Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent iss uance of cash
or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.
(c)No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company will ha ve no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant
as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or othe rwise advise
such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has any duty or  obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award.8.Miscellaneous.
(a)Use of Proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will consti tute general funds of the Company.
(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed  as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually receiv ed or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
 exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate reco rds will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to ha ve any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
o f shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Se rvice Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any rig ht to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment  of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pur suant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisi ons of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commit ment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has  a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance wi th applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date o f such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the  Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the  time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds  $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according  to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option
Agree ment(s) or any Board or Committee resolutions related thereto.
(g)Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any
Award,  (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably sat isfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial
and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the me rits and risks of
exercising the Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock
subject to the Award for the Participant’ s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwisedistributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inope rative if (A)
the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award has been registered under a then currently
effective registration statement under the Securiti es Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws . The Company may, upon
advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with applicable se curities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.
(h)Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, i n its sole discretion, satisfy any
federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award (including but not limited to income tax, social insurance
contributions, payment on  account or any other taxes) by any of the following means (in addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate) or by a combina tion of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a
cash payment; (ii)  withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in
co nnection with the Award; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of
tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be  necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts  otherwise payable to the
Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.
(i)Electronic Delivery. Any reference herein to a “written” agreement or document will inc lude any agreement or document delivered
electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company’s intranet.
(j)Deferrals. To the extent permitted by  applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock
or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may  be deferred and may establish programs
and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code. Consistent  with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise
providing services to the Company or an Affiliate. The Board is authorized  to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual
percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant’s termination of Continuous S ervice,
and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.
(k)Compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly prov ided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will
be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 4 09A of
the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted
hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to  Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will
incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to th e extent an
Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan  (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common
Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” und er Section 409A of the Code is a
“specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation
from service” (as defined  in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date
that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation fro m service” or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless
such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred wil l be paid in
a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.(l)Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be su bject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the
Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Compa ny’s
securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In
addition, the Board may impose such other clawback,  recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines
necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of  Common Stock or other
cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause.
9.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Other Corporate Events.
(a)Capitalization Adjustments. In the event of a Capitalizatio n Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the
class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and maximum n umber of securities
that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section 3(c); (iii) the class(es) and maximum number of
securities that may be awarded to any per son pursuant to Section 3(d); and (iv) the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of
stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments, and its determinat ion will be final, binding and conclusive.
(b)Dissolution or Liquidation. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of
the Company, and up on ten (10) days prior written notice, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and
outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchas e or a forfeiture condition) will terminate immediately prior
to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company’s repurchase rights or a forfe iture
condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing
Continuous Service, provided, however, that the Board may, in  its sole discretion, cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested,
exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expire d or terminated)
before the dissolution or liquidation is completed but contingent on its completion.

Transaction), and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Common Stock issued pursuant to Stock Award s

of the Corporate Transaction) be accelerated in full to a date prior to the e ffective time of such Corporate Transaction as the Board will determine
(or, if the Board will not determine such a date, to the date that is five business (5) days prior to the effective time of the  Corporate Transaction),
and such StockAwards will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, and any reacquisition or

however, that any reacquisition  or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to such Stock Awards will not terminate and may
continue to be exercised notwithstanding the Corporate Transaction.
(d)Change in Control.
(i) Sto ck Awards May Be Assumed. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a Change in
Control, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquirin g corporation’s parent company) may assume or continue
any or all Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or may substitute similar stock awards for Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan
(including  but not limited to, awards to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Change in

10.Termination or Suspension of the Plan.
(a)Plan Term. Unless sooner terminated by the Boa rd pursuant to Section 2, the Plan will automatically terminate on the day before the

This Plan will become effective on the Effective Date.
12.Choice of Law.
The law of the State of Delaware will govern all questions concerning the constru ction, validity and interpretation of this Plan, without regard
to that state’s conflict of laws rules.
13.Definitions.
As used in the Plan, the following definitions will apply to the capitalized ter ms indicated below:
(a)“Affiliate” means, at the time of determination, any “parent” or “subsidiary” of the Company as such terms are defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act. The Board will have the  authority to determine the time or times at which “parent” or “subsidiary” status is determined within the
foregoing definition.
(b)“Award” means a Stock Award or a Performance Cash Award.
(c)“Award  Agreement” means a written agreement between the Company and a Participant evidencing the terms and conditions of an
Award.
(d)“Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.
(e)“Capitalization A djustment” means any change that is made in, or other events that occur with respect to, the Common Stock subject
to the Plan or subject to any Stock Award after the Effective Date without the receipt  of consideration by the Company through merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating
divide nd, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or any similar equity restructuring transaction, as that term is
used in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting St andards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor thereto). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company will not be treated as a Capitalization Adjustment .
(f)“Cause” means (i) if a Participant is party to an agreement with the Company or an Affiliate that relates to equity awards and contains a
definition of “Cause,” the definition of “Cause” in the a pplicable agreement, or (ii) if a Participant is not party to any such agreement, such
Participant’s termination because of (A) any willful, material violation by theParticipant of any law or regulati on applicable to the business of the Company or an Affiliate, the Participant’s conviction for, or guilty plea to, a
felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, or any willful perpetration by the Par ticipant of a common law fraud, (B) the Participant’s commission
of an act of personal dishonesty that involves personal profit in connection with the Company or any other entity having a business rel ationship
with the Company, (C) any material breach by the Participant of any provision of any agreement or understanding between the Company or an
Affiliate and the Participant regarding the terms of  the Participant’s service as an Employee, Officer, Director or Consultant to the Company or an
Affiliate, including without limitation, the willful and continued failure or refusal of the Participant  to perform the material duties required of such
Participant as an Employee, Officer, Director or Consultant of the Company or an Affiliate, other than as a result of having a Disability, or a
breach  of any applicable invention assignment and confidentiality agreement or similar agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the
Participant, (D) the Participant’s disregard of the policies of th e Company or an Affiliate so as to cause loss, damage or injury to the property,
reputation or employees of the Company or an Affiliate, or (E) any other misconduct by the Participant that is material ly injurious to the financial
condition or business reputation of, or is otherwise materially injurious to, the Company or an Affiliate.
(g) “Change in Control” means the occurrence, in a single trans action or in a series of related transactions, of any one or more of the
following events:
(i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company represent ing more than 50%
of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Cha nge in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by
an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Compa ny’s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, or (B) solely because
 the level of Ownership held by any Exchange Act Person (the “Subject Person”) exceeds the designated percentage threshold of the
outstanding voting securities as a result of a repurchase or other acqu isition of voting securities by the Company reducing the number of shares
outstanding, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acqu isition of voting
securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition, the Subject Person becomes the Owner of any additional voting securities that,
assuming the repurchase or other acquisiti on had not occurred, increases the percentage of the then outstanding voting securities Owned by the
Subject Person over the designated percentage threshold, then a Change in Control will be deemed to  occur;
(ii) there is consummated a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving (directly or indirectly) the Company and,
immediately after the consummation of such merger, consolidation or  similar transaction, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
thereto do not Own, directly or indirectly, either (A) outstanding voting securities representing more than 50% of the combined  outstanding voting
power of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction or (B) more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power
of the parent of the surviving Entit y in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as
their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to s uch transaction;
(iii) there is consummated a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than  a sale, lease, license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to an Entity, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the  voting securities of which are Owned by
stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company
immediately prior to su ch sale, lease, license or other disposition; or
(iv) individuals who, on the date this Plan is adopted by the Board, are members of the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for
any reason to constitut e at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the appointment or election (or nomination for
election) of any new Board member was approved orrecommended by a majority  vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered as a member of the Incumbent Board.
For purposes of determining voting p ower under the term Change in Control, voting power will be calculated by assuming the conversion of
all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote , but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or
right to subscribe to or purchase those shares. In addition, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other
transac tion effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any
analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Co mpany or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing
definition with respect to Awards subject to such agreement; provided, however, that if no definition of Change in Control or an y analogous term
is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply; provided, further, that no Change in Control will be deemed
to occur upon announcement or co mmencement of a tender offer or upon a potential takeover or upon stockholder approval of a merger or other
transaction, in each case without a requirement that the Change in Control actually occur.
I f required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such
transaction is not also a “change in the ownership or effective control  of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of
the assets of” the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative  definition

Compute & Networking revenue – The increa se in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2024 was due to strengt h in Data Center computing and networking for accelerat ed computing and AI solutions. Revenue from GPU computing grew 166% year-
on-year and 257% compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU architecture computin g platform for training and
inferencing of large language models, recomm endation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was also up 114% year-on-year and 159%
compared to the first half  of last year driven by both InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue.
28Graphics revenue  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first  half of fiscal year 2024 was led
by higher sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compa red to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2024 in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.
All Other operating loss – The incre ase in the second  quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024
was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and c ompensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises  and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal year 2025, r espectively , and 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively .
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct cus tomers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integ rators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal re sources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service provide rs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Comp ute & Networking segment, are
presented in the following table:

Customer A 14 % 14 %
Customer B 11 % *
Customer C 11 % *
Customer D 10 %  10 %
Customer E * 10 %
* Less than 10% of total revenue
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distrib utors, including
through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represent 10% or more of total revenue attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
For the first half of fiscal year 202 5, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products from system integrators and distributors, including from
Customer E, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable  to the Compute & Networking segment.
Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data
 and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may dif fer from our estimates.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,  and this trend may continue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.
Our overall gross margi n increased to 75.1% and 76.6% for the second quart er and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , from 70.1% and 68.2% for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The increases in the second quarter and first half  of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 154% and 234% for the second quarter and first half of
 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively ,  and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 millio n and $199 million for the second quarter  and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively . The net effect on
our
29gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $576 million and $709 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal  year 2024,
respectively . Sales of previously reserved invent ory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $84 million and
$134 million  for the seco nd quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 3.6% and
2.8% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, re spectively .
We expect our Data Center mix to continue to shift to new products in the second half of fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in
the mid-70% range.

The increas es in interest income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 was due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and publicly-held debt
secu rity balances.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other , net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in  privately-held equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact
of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other , net, compared to the second quarter and first half of fis cal year 2024 was primarily driven by an
increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statem ents in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity
securities.
30Income T axes
We recognized i ncome tax expense of $2.6 billion and $5.0 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and $793 million and
$958 million for the second quarter and first half of  fiscal year 2024, respectively . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.6%
and 13.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and 11.4%  and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,
respectively .
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intang ible income deduction relative to the increase
in income before income tax.
Given our current and anticipated future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation  allowance associated with c ertain state deferred tax assets in
the near term, which would decrease our income  tax expense for the period the release is recor ded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release
could  vary based on our assessment of all available evidence.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (8, 877) $ (1,287)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,665) $ (5,479)
Our investm ent policy requires the purchase of high-rated fixed income securities, the diversi fication of investment types a nd credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024  due to growth in revenue, partially
offset by higher tax paym ents. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2025 reflects the strong revenue growth, partially offse t
by $2.8 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal  year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of
marketable securities, and acquisition of land and buildings.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared  to the first half of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 28, 2024, we
had $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liqui dity to meet our operating requirements for at least
the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our  liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-he ld equity securities,  debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by hig hly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt
securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Co nsolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
31Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable se curities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities held outside the U.S.
as of July 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Payment from customers, per our standard paym ent term s, is generally due shortly after delivery  of products, availability of software licenses or commencement
of services.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the second quarter and first half of fisca l year 2025, we paid $246 million and $344 million, respectively , in quarterly cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our  Board of Directors' continuing determination that the
dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On June 7, 2024, we increased our qua rterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024. Our
quarterly cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024.
During the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and
$15.1 billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were authorized, su bject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock. On
August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approve d an additional $50.0 billion to our share repurchase authoriz ation, without expiration. As of August 26, 2024, a
total of $53.9 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while main taining
adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment
opportunities. W e plan to continue share repu rchases this fiscal year .
From April 29, 2024 through August 26, 2024, we repurchased 31.5 million shares for $3.6 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The U.S. Inflation Reduc tion Act of  2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost a nd was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $186 million recorded in non-current income tax p ayable as of
July 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability , interest payme nts, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the
underlying income tax  positions and the timing of
32the ef fective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the cont ractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations

foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 20 24.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of July 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
i nformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and f orms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions reg arding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or ar e reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update  much of
our existing core financia l systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will
occur in phases. W e will cont inue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ  ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control sys tem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must re flect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation o f controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.

proceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “L egal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk facto rs liste d below , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A  of our  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA  common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Ite m 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024, and below . Any
one of  those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends  and uncertainties not present ly known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
Long manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply an d component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,
has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and asse mb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component
or capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a  quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in  both product shortages and
excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advanc e of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments f or capacity to address our business needs, or our
long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary fo r the
finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited  supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 m onths. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scal e their capabilities to meet
our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply
commitments at th e same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our pr oducts,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
 •competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•changes in business and economic conditions;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues ;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting  in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end-use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products;
•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated computing,  AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
34•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products; or
•government a ctions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
We continue to increase our supply and capacit y purchases with existing and new supplier s to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have
also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.  The increased purchase
volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with
variations in productio n planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to
increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incu r inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments
exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may cha nge or may not be correct, as we have
experienced in the past.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare  to ship and support
new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.
The computing industr y is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center arc hitectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year
and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the la rger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating
product transi tions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in
our revenue . We have experienced and may in the fut ure experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate
transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and f uture architecture transitions. If we are unable to
execute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and comp lexity of
newly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other
costs or result in produc t delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory pro visions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the
future.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product road map may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may  not be
able to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple pro duct archit ectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customer s often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through
multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by o ur multiple OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have
impacted and c ould in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various
downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers'  future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely  basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be
able to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient sup ply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill
our custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputa tion
could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any
one component have had and may  have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able  to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have imple mented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a  result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and rec orded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of
our historical  lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of
35these impac ts has increased and may continue  to increase as our purchase obligations an d prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and
become a greater portion of our total supply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Demand  estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to
generate significant revenue from them. Recent   technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for
Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multi ple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with
any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
Challenges  in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natur al disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,  contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed a nd marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future
impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, se veral years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to
be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact  of
cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price change s in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in
the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the futu re impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further
impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not  limited to, the Ethereum 2.0
merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sale s of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or
previously sold products may be resold online or on the unau thorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and
reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.
Additionally , we depend  on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publi shers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by
developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our p latforms, or failure by third-party content providers
or publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adverse ly affect
customer demand.
We receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to
customers who purchase directly or  indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of
these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited numb er of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to direct Customers, A, B,
C and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal  year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to
the Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio throug h their
channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. We have a small number of  partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly
complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key custome rs. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their
ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to custome rs. In the future, these
partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.
Because most of  our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little
notice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or custome rs may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and
our partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our pr oducts, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’
purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,  distributors
and other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators
and distributors, includin g through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &
Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supp ly availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors
and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amoun t of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them,
36our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to whic h our business is subject, and political and other actions may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas inclu ding, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; impor t and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreig n exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; data priva cy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and s afety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,  and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to
manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not  violate applicable laws
or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions
against us,  our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations
to which we are subject, or changes to their inte rpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For  example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result
of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity v ulnerabilities and risks.
Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,
the United Ki ngdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Author ity collected information from us regarding our business and
competition in the graph ics card and cloud service provider marke t as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received
requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, a nd South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs,
our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions
on the hardw are, software, and system s used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June
2024 and will be implemented in phases betwee n now and 2030. The State of Calif ornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions
under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, d elay or halt deployment of new systems
using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or
regulation s or their interpretation and enforceme nt could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or  exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our
shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in  the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our
business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security polic ies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sa nctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with  entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligation s and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation oc curred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial co ndition.
For example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, s ervices and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukr aine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that ta rget products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.
Concerns regardin g third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the f uture result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and c ould in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our busines s and financial results.
37Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.
As ge opolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export
control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in t he U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to Chi na, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively a nd materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be furthe r tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvanta ge for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream use rs of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our  cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end custom ers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gam ing products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less  likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impactin g our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial  results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to inclu de deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restric tions may not only impact our ability to serve
overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide  our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our
sales and efforts to supply the China m arket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators
conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any app licable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions
on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating  results and financial condition.
During the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and
supercompu ting industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including  Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing r equirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circu its. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second qu arter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countr ies in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Group s D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A80 0, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate par ent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H80 0, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validatio n, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distri bution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for
which the USG does not require a  license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing
requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing  process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a
license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved,  it may impose burdensome conditions that
we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that
38does not have clear standard s or an opportunity  for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for
exports of products to customers in China. The license process for e xports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions
that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements  have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new 
restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive
position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the
geographic,  customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we
are unable to provide contractual warranty or othe r extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to
significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants an y requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose
burdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certa in of our competitors,
as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to
pursue alternatives  to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may aga in change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial resu lts. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively exclu ding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms t o create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions su ch as requiring chip tracking and throttling
mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has
a lready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a
significant portion of our supply and dis tribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export co ntrols may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to
those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our product s, which are warehoused in and distributed
from Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in serve rs
containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large cluster s for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competit ors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions t o “design-out” certain
U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or
shifting export contr ols have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our
competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our busin ess, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls
may negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets , such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is  ready for
market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,
which would be less likely t o be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and i ncreased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or  any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the
Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products mad e by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another
example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per
memory  bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way
that effectively prevents us from being able to de sign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center
products and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating result s and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the
products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
39Finally , our business depends on our abi lity to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or serv ices from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
During the secon d quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and $15.1
billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were a uthorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a  Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase
programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions , applicable
legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA  to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be
suspended at any time at our discretio n.

1. General.
(a )Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation
1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 199 8 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation
2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Followi ng the
Effective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the
terms of this Plan except as follows: from the  Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company
anticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Empl oyees, Directors or Consultants who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan
covering up to an aggrega te of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign
nationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Fo reign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all
of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that
t he issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of
shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards grant ed following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign
Transition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for  issuance under this Plan as
provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that
expire or terminate for any reaso n prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for
issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in th is Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted
under the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
(b)Eligible Award Re cipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (i i) Nonstatutory Stock Options,
(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance
Cash Awards, and (viii)  Other Stock Awards.(d)Purpose. The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive
Awards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide i ncentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any
Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit fr om increases in value of the Common
Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to  “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant
to the transition relief provided by the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in
effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by  the Board, in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.
2. Administration.
(a)Administration by Board.  The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b)Powers of Board. The Board will have th e power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (B)  when and how each
Award will be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not
be identical), including the time or t imes when a person will be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; (E) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and (F) the Fair Ma rket Value applicable to a Stock Award.
(ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its
administration. The Board,  in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award
Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to th e extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the
Plan or Award fully effective.
(iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iv) To accelerate the time at  which an Award may be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it m ay be exercised or the time during which it
will vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Plan to the c ontrary, the time at which a Participant’s Award may be exercised or the time during which a Participant’s Award or any part thereof
will vest may only be accelerated in the event of the Participant’s  death or Disability or in the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement,  suspension or
termination of the Plan will not materially impair a Participant’s rights under his or her then-outstanding Award without his or her written consent.
(vi) To amend the Plan in any respec t the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive
Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bri ng the Plan or Awards granted under
the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section 9(a) relating to
Capitalization Ad justments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) mat erially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at w hich shares of Common
Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) materially expands the types of Awards
available for issuance under the Plan , but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
the Plan or an AwardAgreement, rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan  will not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless
(i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing.
(vii) To submit any  amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereu nder regarding the exclusion of performance-based
compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding
Incentive Sto ck Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
(viii) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including,
but not limited to, amendments to provi de terms more favorable than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits
in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided however, that, except with respe ct to amendments that disqualify or impair the
status of an Incentive Stock Option or as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, the rights under any Award will not be
materially impaire d by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant
consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitation s of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participant’s
consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary (A) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as a n
Incentive Stock Option, (B) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
the related guidance thereunder, or (C) to comply with o ther applicable laws.
(ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best
interests of the Company and that are not in confli ct with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
(x) To adopt such procedures or terms and sub-plans (none of which will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan) as are
necessary or desirable to  permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or
employed or located outside the United States.
(c)Delegation to Committee.
(i) Genera l. The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration
of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection  with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore
possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of
 the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee
or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions,  not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by
the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan  with the Committee and may, at
any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.
(ii) Section 162(m) and Rule 16b-3 Compliance. The Committee may consist solely of two or  more Outside Directors, in
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3. In addition, the
Board or the Committee, in its s ole discretion, may (A) delegate to a Committee who need not be Outside Directors the authority to grant Awards
to eligible persons who are either (I) not then Covered Employees and are not expected t o be Covered Employees at the time of recognition of
income resulting from such Stock Award, or (II) not persons with respect to whom the Company wishes to comply with Section 162(m) of the
Code, and/ or (B) delegate to a Committee who need not be Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Stock Awards to eligible persons who
are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
(d)Delegation  to Other Person or Body. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more persons or bodies the authority to do
one or more of the following to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) design ate recipients, other than Officers, of Stock Awards, provided that
no person or body may be delegated authority to grant a Stock Award to themself; (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock  subject
to such Stock Awards; and(iii) determine the terms of such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Board or Committee action regarding such delegation will fix the
terms of such delegation  in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation Sections 152 and 157 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Unless provided otherwise in the Board or Committee action regarding such  delegation, each Stock Award granted pursuant to
this section will be granted on the applicable form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee,
with any mod ifications necessary to incorporate or reflect the terms of such Stock Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2(d), neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to any per son or body (who is not a Director or that is not comprised solely of Directors,
respectively) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 13(x)(iii) below.
(e)Effect of Board ’s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(f)Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards. Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise
or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation  Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancel any outstanding Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash o r other Stock
Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.
(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Divide nds or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the applicable Award Agr eement; provided,
however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested
under the terms of such Award Agreement, (i i) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of such Award Ag reement (including, but not limited to, any
vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to the
Company on t he date, if any, such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to meet any vesting conditions under
the terms of such Award Agreement.
3.Shares Subject to the Plan.
(a)Sh are Reserve. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards  after the Effective Date will not exceed 10,289,710,640 shares
(the “2007 Plan Reserve”). Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) 152,767,766 shares, which is the total
re serve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the
shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans on t he Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000
shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Mee ting of
Stockholders), (iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 shares that
were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting o f Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockho lders, (vii)
733,103,298 shares that were added to reflect a 4-for-1 stock split effective July 19, 2021, (viii) 51,500,000 shares that were approved at the
Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholde rs, and (ix) 9,260,739,576 shares that were added to reflect a 10-for-1 stock split effective June
7, 2024. For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number of sha res of Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a). Shares may
be issued in conn ection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule,  and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares
available for issuance under the Plan.
 The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 s tock split effective September 10, 2007.1
1(b)Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve.
(i) Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise te rminate, in
whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at thei r original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Company’s reacquisition or repurchase
rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or  condition required for the vesting of
such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or
repurchased by the Comp any, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participan t
because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award (including any shares subject to a
Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant beca use the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock
Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in s hares of Common Stock, the
number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under
the Plan. If any shares subjec t to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in
satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number  of shares that are not delivered to the Participant
shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise or purchase price of any Stock Award, or the withholding of
taxes  incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual
delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered s hall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares
of Common Stock are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of  a Stock Award,
then the number of shares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(c)Incentive Stock Option Limit. Subject to the 2007 Plan Reserve and the pr ovisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options under the  Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) will be 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
(d)Individual Award Limitations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relati ng to Capitalization Adjustments, no Participant will be
eligible to be granted during any fiscal year:
(i) Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by refer ence to an increase over an
exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more
than 80,000,000 shares of Comm on Stock;
(ii) Performance Stock Awards covering more than 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and
(iii) Performance Cash Awards with a value of more than $6,000,000.
If a Performance Stock Award is in  the form of an Option, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award limit. If a Performance
Stock Award could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award lim it.
(e)Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including
shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or other wise.
4.Eligibility.
(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a “parent
corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as  such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than
Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, that Stoc k Awards may not be granted to
Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Rule 405 of the SecuritiesAct,  unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under Section 409A of the Code (for example,
because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate tran saction such as a spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in connection with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) the  Company, in
connection with its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent S tockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such
Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Optio n is not exercisable after the
expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c)Consultants. A Consultant will be eligible for the grant of an Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Re gistration Statement
under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (“Form S-8”) is available to register either the offer or the sale of
the Company’s securities to  such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the
Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of For m S-8.
5.Provisions Relating to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board will deem appropriate. All Option s will be
separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate
certificate or certificates will be issued for s hares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically
designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option  but some portion or all of the Option fails to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The
provision s of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Agreement will include (through incorporation
of provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherw ise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the
expiratio n of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement (the “Expiration Date”).
(b)Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding T en Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the
Award Agreement to the contrary, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value subject to  the
Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike
price lower than the Fair Market Value subject to the Awar d if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option
or stock appreciation right in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A and, if applicable, Secti on 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.
(c)Consideration. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be p aid, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.
The Board will have the authority to  grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to
use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to uti lize a particular method of payment. The methods of
payment permitted by this Section 5(c) are:
(i) by cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer payable to the Company;
(ii) pu rsuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance
of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or c heck) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay
the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;(iii) if an option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a “net  exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not 
exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent
of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise pric e not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided,
further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable t hereafter to the extent that (A)
shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as
a result of such exe rcise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Ag reement.
(d)Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the
Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Apprec iation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution
payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value  (on the date of
the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is
vested under such SAR, and with respect to w hich the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price. The appreciation
distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other fo rm of consideration, as determined by the
Board and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.
(e)Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such lim itations on the transferability of Options
and SARs as the Board will determine. If the Board determines that an Option or SAR will be transferable, the Option or SAR will contain such
additional term s and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the
following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or
pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below) and will be exercisa ble during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner consistent with appl icable tax and securities
laws upon the Participant’s request. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.
(ii) Domestic Relations Orders. N otwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or official marital settleme nt agreement; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoi ng, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a
Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company (o r the designated
broker), designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and
receive the Common Stock or other con sideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or
administrator of the Participant’s estate (or other party legally entitled to the Option or SAR proceeds)  will be entitled to exercise the Option or
SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a
beneficiary at any  time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of
applicable laws or difficult to administer.
(f)Vesting Generally. The total numb er of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become
exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other  terms and conditions on the
time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board
may deem appropriate. The ve sting provisions ofindividual Options or SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then the  Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service.
The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing th e minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to
which an Option or SAR may be exercised.
(g)Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other  agreement between
the Participant and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant’s
death or Disability), the Participant  may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award
as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time  ending on the earlier of (i) the date 90 days following the
termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agree ment. If,
after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the
Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or  SAR will terminate.
(h)Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service
(other than for Cause or upon the Participan t’s death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of
Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the  Participant to short-swing liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act due to a transaction engaged in by the Participant prior to his or her termination of Continuous Service, then
the Option o r SAR will terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of 90 days after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous
Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not  be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the
Participant to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Optio n or SAR as set forth in
the Award Agreement. All determinations under this Section 5(h) will be made in the sole discretion of the Board.
(i)Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in  the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant
and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s Disability,  the Participant may
exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service), but only wi thin such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous
Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the A ward Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service,
the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the  Option
or SAR will terminate.
(j)Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and
the Company, in the event that (i)  a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s death (which termination event
will give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), or (ii) the  Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the
Award Agreement after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event will not give ris e to
acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled
to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of d eath) by the Participant’s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or
SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participa nt’s death, but only within the period
ending on the earlier of (A) the date 18 months following the date of death, or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in
the Award Ag reement. If, after the Participant’s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR will terminate.
(k)Terminat ion for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant’s Award Agreement, or other individual written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Particip ant’s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or
SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant’s termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will be prohibited from ex ercising
his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.(l)Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for p urposes of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of
grant of the Option or SAR (al though the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Corporat e Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed,
continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the
Parti cipant’s Award Agreement or in another agreement between the Participant and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with
the Company’s then current employment policies and guidelines),  the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six
(6) months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non- exempt employee in
connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or
required for compliance with the Worke r Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection
with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from  the employee’s regular rate of pay, the
provisions of this Section 5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.
6.Provisions of Stock  Awards other than Options and SARs.
(a)Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as
the Board will deem appropriat e. To the extent consistent with the Company’s Bylaws, at the Board’s election, shares of Common Stock may be
(x) held in book entry form subject to the Company’s instructions until any restrictions r elating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or
(y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of
Restricte d Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award
Agreements need not be identical, provided, however, that each Restricted Stock A ward Agreement will include (through incorporation of the
provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(i) Consideration. A Re stricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft, money order or
electronic funds transfer payable to the Company, (B) past services rendered to the Company or an A ffiliate, or (C) any other form of legal
consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. Shar es of Common Stock awarded under a Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the
Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board; provided, however,  that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s
Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Award will become fully vested as of the date of
termination of  Continuous Service.
(iii) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates, the Company
may receive via a forfeiture condition or a repurcha se right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not
vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreem ent.
(iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by
the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set fo rth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board will determine in its
sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms  of the Restricted
Stock Award Agreement.
(b)Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will  deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to
time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need  not be identical, provided, however, that each
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement willinclude (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the s ubstance of each of the following
provisions:
(i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be
paid by the Participan t upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if
any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricte d Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration
that may be acceptable to the Board in its sole discretion and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. At the time of the gran t of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions or conditions to the
vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate; provided, h owever, that in all cases, in the event a
Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Unit Award will become fully vested as of
the date of t ermination of Continuous Service.
(iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any
combination thereof or in any other  form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreement.
(iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, t he Board, as it deems appropriate, may
impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted
Stock Unit Award  to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.
(v) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreeme nt, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant’s termination of Continuous
Service.
(c)Performance Awards.
(i) Performance Stock Awards.  A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest
or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals.  A Performance Stock Award may
require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his
or her death, then the P erformance Stock Award will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of the target level of performance, will be fully
vested, as of the date of death, and shares thereunder will be issued promptly follo wing the date of death. The length of any Performance
Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such
Performance Goals h ave been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to the extent that an Award is not intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the  Board), in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that cash may be
us ed in payment of Performance Stock Awards.
(ii) Performance Cash Awards. A Performance Cash Award is a cash award that is payable contingent upon the attainment during
a Performance Period of certain  Performance Goals. A Performance Cash Award may also require the completion of a specified period of
Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved duri ng the Performance Period, and the
measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to
the extent that an Award is  not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board), in its
sole discretion. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may provide for or, subject  to such terms and conditions as the Board or the
Committee, as applicable, may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Cash Award to be deferred to a
specified  date or event. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may specify the form of payment of Performance Cash Awards, which may
be cash or other property, or may provide for a Participant to have the  option for his or her Performance Cash Award, or such portion thereof as
the Board or theCommittee, as applicable, may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, t o the extent permitted by applicable
law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that Common Stock authorized under this
Plan may be used in paymen t of Performance Cash Awards, including additional shares in excess of the Performance Cash Award as an
inducement to hold shares of Common Stock.
(iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise per mitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code
with respect to any Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” thereunder, the Committee will establish the  Performance
Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after
the commencement of the applicable Performa nce Period, and (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in any
event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Pr ior to the payment of any
compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will
certify the extent to which any Perfo rmance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases
where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). With respect to any Awar d intended to qualify as “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due
upon the attainment of the a pplicable Performance Goals on the basis of any such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine.
(d)Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole  or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock,
including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and  the
preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including, but not limited to, Section 2(g)), the Board will have sole
and complete authority to determine the perso ns to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number
of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awar ds and all other terms and
conditions of such Other Stock Awards; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then  any Other Stock Awards held by such Participant will become fully vested as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service.
7.Covenants of the Company.
(a)Availability of Shares. During the terms o f the Stock Awards, the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of
Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
(b)Securities Law Compliance. The Company will s eek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the
Plan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue an d sell shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities
Act the Plan, any Stock Award or  any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if
the cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the ben efits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such
regulator y commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common
Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for f ailure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock
Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent iss uance of cash
or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.
(c)No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company will ha ve no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant
as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or othe rwise advise
such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has any duty or  obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award.8.Miscellaneous.
(a)Use of Proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will consti tute general funds of the Company.
(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed  as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually receiv ed or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
 exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate reco rds will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to ha ve any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
o f shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Se rvice Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any rig ht to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment  of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pur suant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisi ons of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commit ment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has  a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance wi th applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date o f such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the  Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the  time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds  $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according  to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option
Agree ment(s) or any Board or Committee resolutions related thereto.
(g)Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any
Award,  (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably sat isfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial
and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the me rits and risks of
exercising the Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock
subject to the Award for the Participant’ s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwisedistributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inope rative if (A)
the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award has been registered under a then currently
effective registration statement under the Securiti es Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws . The Company may, upon
advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with applicable se curities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.
(h)Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, i n its sole discretion, satisfy any
federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award (including but not limited to income tax, social insurance
contributions, payment on  account or any other taxes) by any of the following means (in addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate) or by a combina tion of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a
cash payment; (ii)  withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in
co nnection with the Award; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of
tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be  necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts  otherwise payable to the
Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.
(i)Electronic Delivery. Any reference herein to a “written” agreement or document will inc lude any agreement or document delivered
electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company’s intranet.
(j)Deferrals. To the extent permitted by  applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock
or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may  be deferred and may establish programs
and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code. Consistent  with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise
providing services to the Company or an Affiliate. The Board is authorized  to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual
percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant’s termination of Continuous S ervice,
and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.
(k)Compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly prov ided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will
be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 4 09A of
the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted
hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to  Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will
incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to th e extent an
Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan  (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common
Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” und er Section 409A of the Code is a
“specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation
from service” (as defined  in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date
that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation fro m service” or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless
such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred wil l be paid in
a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.(l)Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be su bject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the
Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Compa ny’s
securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In
addition, the Board may impose such other clawback,  recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines
necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of  Common Stock or other
cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause.
9.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Other Corporate Events.
(a)Capitalization Adjustments. In the event of a Capitalizatio n Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the
class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and maximum n umber of securities
that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section 3(c); (iii) the class(es) and maximum number of
securities that may be awarded to any per son pursuant to Section 3(d); and (iv) the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of
stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments, and its determinat ion will be final, binding and conclusive.
(b)Dissolution or Liquidation. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of
the Company, and up on ten (10) days prior written notice, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Cha nge in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by
an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Compa ny’s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, or (B) solely because

power of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction or (B) more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power
of the parent of the surviving Entit y in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as

any reason to constitut e at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the appointment or election (or nomination for
election) of any new Board member was approved orrecommended by a majority  vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered as a member of the Incumbent Board.
For purposes of determining voting p ower under the term Change in Control, voting power will be calculated by assuming the conversion of
all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote , but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or
right to subscribe to or purchase those shares. In addition, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other
transac tion effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any
analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Co mpany or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing
definition with respect to Awards subject to such agreement; provided, however, that if no definition of Change in Control or an y analogous term
is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply; provided, further, that no Change in Control will be deemed
to occur upon announcement or co mmencement of a tender offer or upon a potential takeover or upon stockholder approval of a merger or other
transaction, in each case without a requirement that the Change in Control actually occur.
I f required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such
transaction is not also a “change in the ownership or effective control  of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of
the assets of” the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative  definition
thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s consent, amend the definition of “Change in Control” to conform to

(h)“Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.
(i)“Committee” me ans a committee of one (1) or more Directors to whom authority has been delegated by the Board in accordance with

Compute & Networking revenue – The increa se in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2024 was due to strengt h in Data Center computing and networking for accelerat ed computing and AI solutions. Revenue from GPU computing grew 166% year-
on-year and 257% compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU architecture computin g platform for training and
inferencing of large language models, recomm endation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was also up 114% year-on-year and 159%
compared to the first half  of last year driven by both InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue.
28Graphics revenue  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first  half of fiscal year 2024 was led
by higher sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compa red to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2024 in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.
All Other operating loss – The incre ase in the second  quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024
was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and c ompensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises  and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal year 2025, r espectively , and 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively .
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct cus tomers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integ rators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal re sources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service provide rs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Comp ute & Networking segment, are
presented in the following table:
 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended
 Jul 28, 2024 Jul 28, 2024
Customer A 14 % 14 %
Customer B 11 % *
Customer C 11 % *
Customer D 10 %  10 %
Customer E * 10 %
* Less than 10% of total revenue
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distrib utors, including
through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represent 10% or more of total revenue attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
For the first half of fiscal year 202 5, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products from system integrators and distributors, including from
Customer E, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable  to the Compute & Networking segment.
Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data
 and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may dif fer from our estimates.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,  and this trend may continue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.
Our overall gross margi n increased to 75.1% and 76.6% for the second quart er and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , from 70.1% and 68.2% for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The increases in the second quarter and first half  of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 154% and 234% for the second quarter and first half of
 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively ,  and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 millio n and $199 million for the second quarter  and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively . The net effect on
our
29gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $576 million and $709 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal  year 2024,
respectively . Sales of previously reserved invent ory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $84 million and
$134 million  for the seco nd quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 3.6% and
2.8% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, re spectively .
We expect our Data Center mix to continue to shift to new products in the second half of fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in
the mid-70% range.

The increases in research and development expenses for the second q uarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 were driven by 35% and 34% increase in
compensation and benefits, including stock-bas ed compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases,  and 118% and 117% increase in
compute and infrastructure investments, respectively .
The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 20 25 was primarily driven by compensation and
benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.
For fiscal year 2025, we expect operating expenses to g row in the mid to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products.

The increas es in interest income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 was due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and publicly-held debt
secu rity balances.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other , net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in  privately-held equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact
of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other , net, compared to the second quarter and first half of fis cal year 2024 was primarily driven by an
increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statem ents in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity
securities.
30Income T axes
We recognized i ncome tax expense of $2.6 billion and $5.0 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and $793 million and
$958 million for the second quarter and first half of  fiscal year 2024, respectively . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.6%
and 13.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and 11.4%  and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,
respectively .
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intang ible income deduction relative to the increase
in income before income tax.
Given our current and anticipated future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation  allowance associated with c ertain state deferred tax assets in
the near term, which would decrease our income  tax expense for the period the release is recor ded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release
could  vary based on our assessment of all available evidence.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (8, 877) $ (1,287)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,665) $ (5,479)
Our investm ent policy requires the purchase of high-rated fixed income securities, the diversi fication of investment types a nd credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024  due to growth in revenue, partially
offset by higher tax paym ents. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2025 reflects the strong revenue growth, partially offse t
by $2.8 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal  year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of
marketable securities, and acquisition of land and buildings.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared  to the first half of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 28, 2024, we
had $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liqui dity to meet our operating requirements for at least
the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our  liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-he ld equity securities,  debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by hig hly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt
securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Co nsolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
31Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable se curities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities held outside the U.S.
as of July 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Payment from customers, per our standard paym ent term s, is generally due shortly after delivery  of products, availability of software licenses or commencement
of services.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the second quarter and first half of fisca l year 2025, we paid $246 million and $344 million, respectively , in quarterly cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our  Board of Directors' continuing determination that the
dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On June 7, 2024, we increased our qua rterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024. Our
quarterly cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024.
During the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and
$15.1 billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were authorized, su bject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock. On
August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approve d an additional $50.0 billion to our share repurchase authoriz ation, without expiration. As of August 26, 2024, a
total of $53.9 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while main taining
adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment
opportunities. W e plan to continue share repu rchases this fiscal year .
From April 29, 2024 through August 26, 2024, we repurchased 31.5 million shares for $3.6 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The U.S. Inflation Reduc tion Act of  2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost a nd was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $186 million recorded in non-current income tax p ayable as of
July 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability , interest payme nts, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the
underlying income tax  positions and the timing of
32the ef fective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the cont ractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations
from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for th e fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report o n Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of July 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
i nformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and f orms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions reg arding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or ar e reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update  much of
our existing core financia l systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will
occur in phases. W e will cont inue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ  ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control sys tem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must re flect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation o f controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Pa rt I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “L egal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk facto rs liste d below , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A  of our  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA  common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Ite m 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024, and below . Any
one of  those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends  and uncertainties not present ly known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
Long manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply an d component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,
has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and asse mb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component
or capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a  quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in  both product shortages and
excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advanc e of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments f or capacity to address our business needs, or our
long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary fo r the
finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited  supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 m onths. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scal e their capabilities to meet
our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply
commitments at th e same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our pr oducts,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
 •competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•changes in business and economic conditions;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues ;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting  in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end-use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products;
•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated computing,  AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
34•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products; or
•government a ctions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
We continue to increase our supply and capacit y purchases with existing and new supplier s to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have
also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.  The increased purchase
volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with
variations in productio n planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to
increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incu r inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments
exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may cha nge or may not be correct, as we have
experienced in the past.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare  to ship and support
new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.
The computing industr y is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center arc hitectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year
and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the la rger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating
product transi tions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in
our revenue . We have experienced and may in the fut ure experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate
transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and f uture architecture transitions. If we are unable to
execute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and comp lexity of
newly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other
costs or result in produc t delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory pro visions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the
future.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product road map may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may  not be
able to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple pro duct archit ectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customer s often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through
multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by o ur multiple OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have
impacted and c ould in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various
downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers'  future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely  basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be
able to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient sup ply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill
our custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputa tion
could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any
one component have had and may  have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able  to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have imple mented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a  result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and rec orded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of
our historical  lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of
35these impac ts has increased and may continue  to increase as our purchase obligations an d prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and
become a greater portion of our total supply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Demand  estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to
generate significant revenue from them. Recent   technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for
Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multi ple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with
any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
Challenges  in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natur al disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,  contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed a nd marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future
impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, se veral years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to
be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact  of
cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price change s in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in
the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the futu re impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further
impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not  limited to, the Ethereum 2.0
merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sale s of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or
previously sold products may be resold online or on the unau thorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and
reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.
Additionally , we depend  on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publi shers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by
developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our p latforms, or failure by third-party content providers
or publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adverse ly affect
customer demand.
We receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to
customers who purchase directly or  indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of
these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited numb er of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to direct Customers, A, B,
C and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal  year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to
the Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio throug h their
channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. We have a small number of  partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly
complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key custome rs. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their
ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to custome rs. In the future, these
partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.
Because most of  our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little
notice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or custome rs may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and
our partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our pr oducts, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’
purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,  distributors
and other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators
and distributors, includin g through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &
Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supp ly availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors
and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amoun t of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them,
36our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to whic h our business is subject, and political and other actions may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas inclu ding, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; impor t and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreig n exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; data priva cy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and s afety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,  and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to
manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not  violate applicable laws
or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions
against us,  our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations
to which we are subject, or changes to their inte rpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For  example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result
of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity v ulnerabilities and risks.
Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,
the United Ki ngdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Author ity collected information from us regarding our business and
competition in the graph ics card and cloud service provider marke t as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received
requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, a nd South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs,
our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions
on the hardw are, software, and system s used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June
2024 and will be implemented in phases betwee n now and 2030. The State of Calif ornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions
under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, d elay or halt deployment of new systems
using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or
regulation s or their interpretation and enforceme nt could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or  exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our
shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in  the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our
business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security polic ies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sa nctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with  entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligation s and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation oc curred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial co ndition.
For example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, s ervices and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukr aine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that ta rget products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.
Concerns regardin g third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the f uture result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and c ould in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our busines s and financial results.
37Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.
As ge opolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export
control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in t he U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to Chi na, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively a nd materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be furthe r tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvanta ge for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream use rs of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our  cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end custom ers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gam ing products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less  likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impactin g our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial  results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to inclu de deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restric tions may not only impact our ability to serve
overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide  our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our
sales and efforts to supply the China m arket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators
conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any app licable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions
on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating  results and financial condition.
During the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and
supercompu ting industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including  Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing r equirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circu its. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second qu arter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countr ies in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Group s D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A80 0, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate par ent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H80 0, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validatio n, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distri bution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for
which the USG does not require a  license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing
requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing  process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a
license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved,  it may impose burdensome conditions that
we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that
38does not have clear standard s or an opportunity  for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for
exports of products to customers in China. The license process for e xports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions
that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements  have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new 
restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive
position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the
geographic,  customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we
are unable to provide contractual warranty or othe r extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to
significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants an y requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose
burdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certa in of our competitors,
as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to
pursue alternatives  to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may aga in change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial resu lts. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively exclu ding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms t o create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions su ch as requiring chip tracking and throttling
mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has
a lready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a
significant portion of our supply and dis tribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export co ntrols may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to
those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our product s, which are warehoused in and distributed
from Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in serve rs
containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large cluster s for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competit ors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions t o “design-out” certain
U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or
shifting export contr ols have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our
competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our busin ess, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls
may negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets , such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is  ready for
market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,
which would be less likely t o be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and i ncreased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or  any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the
Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products mad e by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another
example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per
memory  bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way
that effectively prevents us from being able to de sign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center
products and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating result s and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the
products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
39Finally , our business depends on our abi lity to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or serv ices from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.

1. General.
(a )Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation
1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 199 8 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation
2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Followi ng the
Effective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the
terms of this Plan except as follows: from the  Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company
anticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Empl oyees, Directors or Consultants who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan
covering up to an aggrega te of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign
nationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Fo reign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all
of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that
t he issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of
shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards grant ed following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign
Transition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for  issuance under this Plan as
provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that
expire or terminate for any reaso n prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for
issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in th is Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted
under the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
(b)Eligible Award Re cipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (i i) Nonstatutory Stock Options,
(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance
Cash Awards, and (viii)  Other Stock Awards.(d)Purpose. The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive
Awards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide i ncentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any
Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit fr om increases in value of the Common
Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to  “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant
to the transition relief provided by the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in
effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by  the Board, in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.
2. Administration.
(a)Administration by Board.  The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b)Powers of Board. The Board will have th e power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (B)  when and how each
Award will be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not
be identical), including the time or t imes when a person will be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; (E) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and (F) the Fair Ma rket Value applicable to a Stock Award.
(ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its
administration. The Board,  in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award
Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to th e extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the
Plan or Award fully effective.
(iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iv) To accelerate the time at  which an Award may be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it m ay be exercised or the time during which it
will vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Plan to the c ontrary, the time at which a Participant’s Award may be exercised or the time during which a Participant’s Award or any part thereof
will vest may only be accelerated in the event of the Participant’s  death or Disability or in the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement,  suspension or
termination of the Plan will not materially impair a Participant’s rights under his or her then-outstanding Award without his or her written consent.
(vi) To amend the Plan in any respec t the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive
Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bri ng the Plan or Awards granted under
the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section 9(a) relating to
Capitalization Ad justments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) mat erially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at w hich shares of Common
Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) materially expands the types of Awards
available for issuance under the Plan , but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
the Plan or an AwardAgreement, rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan  will not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless
(i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing.
(vii) To submit any  amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereu nder regarding the exclusion of performance-based
compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding
Incentive Sto ck Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
(viii) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including,
but not limited to, amendments to provi de terms more favorable than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits
in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided however, that, except with respe ct to amendments that disqualify or impair the
status of an Incentive Stock Option or as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, the rights under any Award will not be
materially impaire d by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant
consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitation s of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participant’s
consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary (A) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as a n
Incentive Stock Option, (B) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
the related guidance thereunder, or (C) to comply with o ther applicable laws.
(ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best
interests of the Company and that are not in confli ct with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
(x) To adopt such procedures or terms and sub-plans (none of which will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan) as are
necessary or desirable to  permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or
employed or located outside the United States.
(c)Delegation to Committee.

of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection  with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore
possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of
 the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee
or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions,  not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by
the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan  with the Committee and may, at
any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.
(ii) Section 162(m) and Rule 16b-3 Compliance. The Committee may consist solely of two or  more Outside Directors, in
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3. In addition, the
Board or the Committee, in its s ole discretion, may (A) delegate to a Committee who need not be Outside Directors the authority to grant Awards
to eligible persons who are either (I) not then Covered Employees and are not expected t o be Covered Employees at the time of recognition of

(d)Delegation  to Other Person or Body. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more persons or bodies the authority to do
one or more of the following to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) design ate recipients, other than Officers, of Stock Awards, provided that
no person or body may be delegated authority to grant a Stock Award to themself; (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock  subject
to such Stock Awards; and(iii) determine the terms of such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Board or Committee action regarding such delegation will fix the
terms of such delegation  in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation Sections 152 and 157 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Unless provided otherwise in the Board or Committee action regarding such  delegation, each Stock Award granted pursuant to
this section will be granted on the applicable form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee,
with any mod ifications necessary to incorporate or reflect the terms of such Stock Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2(d), neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to any per son or body (who is not a Director or that is not comprised solely of Directors,
respectively) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 13(x)(iii) below.
(e)Effect of Board ’s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(f)Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards. Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise
or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation  Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancel any outstanding Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash o r other Stock
Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.
(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Divide nds or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the applicable Award Agr eement; provided,
however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested
under the terms of such Award Agreement, (i i) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of such Award Ag reement (including, but not limited to, any
vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to the
Company on t he date, if any, such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to meet any vesting conditions under
the terms of such Award Agreement.
3.Shares Subject to the Plan.
(a)Sh are Reserve. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards  after the Effective Date will not exceed 10,289,710,640 shares
(the “2007 Plan Reserve”). Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) 152,767,766 shares, which is the total
re serve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the
shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans on t he Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000
shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Mee ting of
Stockholders), (iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 shares that
were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting o f Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockho lders, (vii)
733,103,298 shares that were added to reflect a 4-for-1 stock split effective July 19, 2021, (viii) 51,500,000 shares that were approved at the
Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholde rs, and (ix) 9,260,739,576 shares that were added to reflect a 10-for-1 stock split effective June
7, 2024. For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number of sha res of Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a). Shares may
be issued in conn ection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule,  and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares
available for issuance under the Plan.
 The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 s tock split effective September 10, 2007.1
1(b)Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve.
(i) Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise te rminate, in
whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at thei r original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Company’s reacquisition or repurchase
rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or  condition required for the vesting of
such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or
repurchased by the Comp any, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participan t
because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award (including any shares subject to a
Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant beca use the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock
Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in s hares of Common Stock, the
number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under
the Plan. If any shares subjec t to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in
satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number  of shares that are not delivered to the Participant
shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise or purchase price of any Stock Award, or the withholding of
taxes  incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual
delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered s hall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares
of Common Stock are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of  a Stock Award,
then the number of shares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(c)Incentive Stock Option Limit. Subject to the 2007 Plan Reserve and the pr ovisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options under the  Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) will be 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
(d)Individual Award Limitations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relati ng to Capitalization Adjustments, no Participant will be
eligible to be granted during any fiscal year:
(i) Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by refer ence to an increase over an
exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more
than 80,000,000 shares of Comm on Stock;
(ii) Performance Stock Awards covering more than 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and
(iii) Performance Cash Awards with a value of more than $6,000,000.
If a Performance Stock Award is in  the form of an Option, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award limit. If a Performance
Stock Award could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award lim it.
(e)Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including
shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or other wise.
4.Eligibility.
(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a “parent
corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as  such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than
Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, that Stoc k Awards may not be granted to
Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Rule 405 of the SecuritiesAct,  unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under Section 409A of the Code (for example,
because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate tran saction such as a spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in connection with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) the  Company, in
connection with its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent S tockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such
Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Optio n is not exercisable after the
expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c)Consultants. A Consultant will be eligible for the grant of an Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Re gistration Statement
under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (“Form S-8”) is available to register either the offer or the sale of
the Company’s securities to  such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the
Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of For m S-8.
5.Provisions Relating to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board will deem appropriate. All Option s will be
separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate
certificate or certificates will be issued for s hares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically
designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option  but some portion or all of the Option fails to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The
provision s of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Agreement will include (through incorporation
of provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherw ise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the
expiratio n of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement (the “Expiration Date”).
(b)Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding T en Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the
Award Agreement to the contrary, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value subject to  the
Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike
price lower than the Fair Market Value subject to the Awar d if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option
or stock appreciation right in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A and, if applicable, Secti on 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.
(c)Consideration. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be p aid, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.
The Board will have the authority to  grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to
use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to uti lize a particular method of payment. The methods of
payment permitted by this Section 5(c) are:
(i) by cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer payable to the Company;
(ii) pu rsuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance
of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or c heck) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay
the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;(iii) if an option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a “net  exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not 
exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent
of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise pric e not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided,
further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable t hereafter to the extent that (A)
shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as
a result of such exe rcise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Ag reement.
(d)Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the
Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Apprec iation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution
payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value  (on the date of
the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is
vested under such SAR, and with respect to w hich the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price. The appreciation
distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other fo rm of consideration, as determined by the
Board and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.
(e)Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such lim itations on the transferability of Options
and SARs as the Board will determine. If the Board determines that an Option or SAR will be transferable, the Option or SAR will contain such
additional term s and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the
following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or
pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below) and will be exercisa ble during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner consistent with appl icable tax and securities
laws upon the Participant’s request. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.
(ii) Domestic Relations Orders. N otwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or official marital settleme nt agreement; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoi ng, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a
Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company (o r the designated
broker), designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and
receive the Common Stock or other con sideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or
administrator of the Participant’s estate (or other party legally entitled to the Option or SAR proceeds)  will be entitled to exercise the Option or
SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a
beneficiary at any  time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of
applicable laws or difficult to administer.
(f)Vesting Generally. The total numb er of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become
exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other  terms and conditions on the
time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board
may deem appropriate. The ve sting provisions ofindividual Options or SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then the  Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service.
The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing th e minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to
which an Option or SAR may be exercised.
(g)Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other  agreement between
the Participant and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant’s
death or Disability), the Participant  may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award
as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time  ending on the earlier of (i) the date 90 days following the
termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agree ment. If,
after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the
Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or  SAR will terminate.
(h)Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service
(other than for Cause or upon the Participan t’s death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of
Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the  Participant to short-swing liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act due to a transaction engaged in by the Participant prior to his or her termination of Continuous Service, then
the Option o r SAR will terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of 90 days after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous
Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not  be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the
Participant to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Optio n or SAR as set forth in
the Award Agreement. All determinations under this Section 5(h) will be made in the sole discretion of the Board.
(i)Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in  the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant
and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s Disability,  the Participant may
exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service), but only wi thin such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous
Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the A ward Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service,
the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the  Option
or SAR will terminate.
(j)Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and
the Company, in the event that (i)  a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s death (which termination event
will give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), or (ii) the  Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the
Award Agreement after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event will not give ris e to
acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled
to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of d eath) by the Participant’s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or
SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participa nt’s death, but only within the period
ending on the earlier of (A) the date 18 months following the date of death, or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in
the Award Ag reement. If, after the Participant’s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR will terminate.
(k)Terminat ion for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant’s Award Agreement, or other individual written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Particip ant’s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or
SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant’s termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will be prohibited from ex ercising
his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.(l)Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for p urposes of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of
grant of the Option or SAR (al though the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Corporat e Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed,
continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the
Parti cipant’s Award Agreement or in another agreement between the Participant and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with
the Company’s then current employment policies and guidelines),  the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six
(6) months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non- exempt employee in
connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or
required for compliance with the Worke r Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection
with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from  the employee’s regular rate of pay, the
provisions of this Section 5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.
6.Provisions of Stock  Awards other than Options and SARs.
(a)Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as
the Board will deem appropriat e. To the extent consistent with the Company’s Bylaws, at the Board’s election, shares of Common Stock may be
(x) held in book entry form subject to the Company’s instructions until any restrictions r elating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or
(y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of
Restricte d Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award
Agreements need not be identical, provided, however, that each Restricted Stock A ward Agreement will include (through incorporation of the
provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(i) Consideration. A Re stricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft, money order or
electronic funds transfer payable to the Company, (B) past services rendered to the Company or an A ffiliate, or (C) any other form of legal
consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. Shar es of Common Stock awarded under a Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the
Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board; provided, however,  that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s
Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Award will become fully vested as of the date of
termination of  Continuous Service.
(iii) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates, the Company
may receive via a forfeiture condition or a repurcha se right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not
vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreem ent.
(iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by
the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set fo rth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board will determine in its
sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms  of the Restricted
Stock Award Agreement.
(b)Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will  deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to
time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need  not be identical, provided, however, that each
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement willinclude (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the s ubstance of each of the following
provisions:
(i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be
paid by the Participan t upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if
any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricte d Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration
that may be acceptable to the Board in its sole discretion and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. At the time of the gran t of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions or conditions to the
vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate; provided, h owever, that in all cases, in the event a
Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Unit Award will become fully vested as of
the date of t ermination of Continuous Service.
(iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any
combination thereof or in any other  form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreement.
(iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, t he Board, as it deems appropriate, may
impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted
Stock Unit Award  to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.
(v) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreeme nt, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant’s termination of Continuous
Service.
(c)Performance Awards.
(i) Performance Stock Awards.  A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest
or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals.  A Performance Stock Award may
require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his
or her death, then the P erformance Stock Award will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of the target level of performance, will be fully
vested, as of the date of death, and shares thereunder will be issued promptly follo wing the date of death. The length of any Performance
Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such
Performance Goals h ave been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to the extent that an Award is not intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the  Board), in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that cash may be
us ed in payment of Performance Stock Awards.
(ii) Performance Cash Awards. A Performance Cash Award is a cash award that is payable contingent upon the attainment during
a Performance Period of certain  Performance Goals. A Performance Cash Award may also require the completion of a specified period of
Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved duri ng the Performance Period, and the
measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to
the extent that an Award is  not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board), in its
sole discretion. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may provide for or, subject  to such terms and conditions as the Board or the
Committee, as applicable, may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Cash Award to be deferred to a
specified  date or event. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may specify the form of payment of Performance Cash Awards, which may
be cash or other property, or may provide for a Participant to have the  option for his or her Performance Cash Award, or such portion thereof as
the Board or theCommittee, as applicable, may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, t o the extent permitted by applicable
law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that Common Stock authorized under this
Plan may be used in paymen t of Performance Cash Awards, including additional shares in excess of the Performance Cash Award as an
inducement to hold shares of Common Stock.
(iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise per mitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code
with respect to any Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” thereunder, the Committee will establish the  Performance
Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after
the commencement of the applicable Performa nce Period, and (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in any
event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Pr ior to the payment of any
compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will
certify the extent to which any Perfo rmance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases
where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). With respect to any Awar d intended to qualify as “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due
upon the attainment of the a pplicable Performance Goals on the basis of any such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine.
(d)Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole  or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock,
including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and  the
preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including, but not limited to, Section 2(g)), the Board will have sole
and complete authority to determine the perso ns to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number
of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awar ds and all other terms and
conditions of such Other Stock Awards; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then  any Other Stock Awards held by such Participant will become fully vested as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service.
7.Covenants of the Company.
(a)Availability of Shares. During the terms o f the Stock Awards, the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of
Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
(b)Securities Law Compliance. The Company will s eek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the
Plan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue an d sell shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities
Act the Plan, any Stock Award or  any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if
the cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the ben efits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such
regulator y commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common
Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for f ailure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock
Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent iss uance of cash
or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.
(c)No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company will ha ve no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant
as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or othe rwise advise
such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has any duty or  obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award.8.Miscellaneous.
(a)Use of Proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will consti tute general funds of the Company.
(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed  as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually receiv ed or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
 exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate reco rds will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to ha ve any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
o f shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Se rvice Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any rig ht to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment  of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pur suant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisi ons of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commit ment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has  a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance wi th applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date o f such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the  Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the  time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds  $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according  to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option
Agree ment(s) or any Board or Committee resolutions related thereto.
(g)Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any
Award,  (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably sat isfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial
and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the me rits and risks of
exercising the Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock
subject to the Award for the Participant’ s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwisedistributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inope rative if (A)
the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award has been registered under a then currently
effective registration statement under the Securiti es Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws . The Company may, upon
advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with applicable se curities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.
(h)Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, i n its sole discretion, satisfy any
federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award (including but not limited to income tax, social insurance
contributions, payment on  account or any other taxes) by any of the following means (in addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate) or by a combina tion of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a
cash payment; (ii)  withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in
co nnection with the Award; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of
tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be  necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts  otherwise payable to the
Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.
(i)Electronic Delivery. Any reference herein to a “written” agreement or document will inc lude any agreement or document delivered
electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company’s intranet.
(j)Deferrals. To the extent permitted by  applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock
or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may  be deferred and may establish programs
and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code. Consistent  with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise
providing services to the Company or an Affiliate. The Board is authorized  to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual
percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant’s termination of Continuous S ervice,
and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.
(k)Compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly prov ided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will
be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 4 09A of
the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted
hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to  Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will
incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to th e extent an
Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan  (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common
Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” und er Section 409A of the Code is a
“specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation
from service” (as defined  in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date
that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation fro m service” or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless
such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred wil l be paid in
a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.(l)Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be su bject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the
Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Compa ny’s
securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In
addition, the Board may impose such other clawback,  recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines
necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of  Common Stock or other
cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause.
9.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Other Corporate Events.
(a)Capitalization Adjustments. In the event of a Capitalizatio n Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the
class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and maximum n umber of securities

securities that may be awarded to any per son pursuant to Section 3(d); and (iv) the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of

the Company, and up on ten (10) days prior written notice, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and
outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchas e or a forfeiture condition) will terminate immediately prior
to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company’s repurchase rights or a forfe iture
condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing
Continuous Service, provided, however, that the Board may, in  its sole discretion, cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested,
exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expire d or terminated)

Control, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquirin g corporation’s parent company) may assume or continue

consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating

(f)“Cause” means (i) if a Participant is party to an agreement with the Company or an Affiliate that relates to equity awards and contains a
definition of “Cause,” the definition of “Cause” in the a pplicable agreement, or (ii) if a Participant is not party to any such agreement, such

Participant, (D) the Participant’s disregard of the policies of th e Company or an Affiliate so as to cause loss, damage or injury to the property,
reputation or employees of the Company or an Affiliate, or (E) any other misconduct by the Participant that is material ly injurious to the financial

(g) “Change in Control” means the occurrence, in a single trans action or in a series of related transactions, of any one or more of the
following events:
(i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company represent ing more than 50%
of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Cha nge in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by
an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Compa ny’s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, or (B) solely because
 the level of Ownership held by any Exchange Act Person (the “Subject Person”) exceeds the designated percentage threshold of the
outstanding voting securities as a result of a repurchase or other acqu isition of voting securities by the Company reducing the number of shares
outstanding, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acqu isition of voting
securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition, the Subject Person becomes the Owner of any additional voting securities that,
assuming the repurchase or other acquisiti on had not occurred, increases the percentage of the then outstanding voting securities Owned by the
Subject Person over the designated percentage threshold, then a Change in Control will be deemed to  occur;
(ii) there is consummated a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving (directly or indirectly) the Company and,
immediately after the consummation of such merger, consolidation or  similar transaction, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
thereto do not Own, directly or indirectly, either (A) outstanding voting securities representing more than 50% of the combined  outstanding voting
power of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction or (B) more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power
of the parent of the surviving Entit y in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as
their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to s uch transaction;
(iii) there is consummated a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of

stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company
immediately prior to su ch sale, lease, license or other disposition; or
(iv) individuals who, on the date this Plan is adopted by the Board, are members of the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for
any reason to constitut e at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the appointment or election (or nomination for
election) of any new Board member was approved orrecommended by a majority  vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered as a member of the Incumbent Board.
For purposes of determining voting p ower under the term Change in Control, voting power will be calculated by assuming the conversion of
all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote , but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or
right to subscribe to or purchase those shares. In addition, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other
transac tion effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any
analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Co mpany or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing
definition with respect to Awards subject to such agreement; provided, however, that if no definition of Change in Control or an y analogous term
is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply; provided, further, that no Change in Control will be deemed
to occur upon announcement or co mmencement of a tender offer or upon a potential takeover or upon stockholder approval of a merger or other
transaction, in each case without a requirement that the Change in Control actually occur.
I f required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such
transaction is not also a “change in the ownership or effective control  of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of
the assets of” the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative  definition
thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s consent, amend the definition of “Change in Control” to conform to
the definition of “Change in Control” under  Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(h)“Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.
(i)“Committee” me ans a committee of one (1) or more Directors to whom authority has been delegated by the Board in accordance with
Section 2(c).
(j)“Common Stock” means the common stock of the Company.

Compute & Networking revenue – The increa se in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2024 was due to strengt h in Data Center computing and networking for accelerat ed computing and AI solutions. Revenue from GPU computing grew 166% year-
on-year and 257% compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU architecture computin g platform for training and
inferencing of large language models, recomm endation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was also up 114% year-on-year and 159%
compared to the first half  of last year driven by both InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue.
28Graphics revenue  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first  half of fiscal year 2024 was led
by higher sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compa red to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2024 in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.
All Other operating loss – The incre ase in the second  quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024
was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and c ompensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises  and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal year 2025, r espectively , and 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively .
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct cus tomers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integ rators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal re sources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service provide rs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Comp ute & Networking segment, are
presented in the following table:

Customer A 14 % 14 %
Customer B 11 % *
Customer C 11 % *
Customer D 10 %  10 %
Customer E * 10 %
* Less than 10% of total revenue
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distrib utors, including
through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represent 10% or more of total revenue attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
For the first half of fiscal year 202 5, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products from system integrators and distributors, including from
Customer E, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable  to the Compute & Networking segment.
Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data
 and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may dif fer from our estimates.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,  and this trend may continue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.
Our overall gross margi n increased to 75.1% and 76.6% for the second quart er and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , from 70.1% and 68.2% for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The increases in the second quarter and first half  of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 154% and 234% for the second quarter and first half of
 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively ,  and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 millio n and $199 million for the second quarter  and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively . The net effect on
our
29gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $576 million and $709 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal  year 2024,
respectively . Sales of previously reserved invent ory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $84 million and
$134 million  for the seco nd quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 3.6% and
2.8% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, re spectively .
We expect our Data Center mix to continue to shift to new products in the second half of fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in
the mid-70% range.

compute and infrastructure investments, respectively .
The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 20 25 was primarily driven by compensation and
benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.
For fiscal year 2025, we expect operating expenses to g row in the mid to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products.

The increas es in interest income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 was due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and publicly-held debt
secu rity balances.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other , net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in  privately-held equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact
of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other , net, compared to the second quarter and first half of fis cal year 2024 was primarily driven by an
increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statem ents in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity
securities.
30Income T axes
We recognized i ncome tax expense of $2.6 billion and $5.0 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and $793 million and
$958 million for the second quarter and first half of  fiscal year 2024, respectively . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.6%
and 13.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and 11.4%  and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,
respectively .
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intang ible income deduction relative to the increase
in income before income tax.
Given our current and anticipated future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation  allowance associated with c ertain state deferred tax assets in
the near term, which would decrease our income  tax expense for the period the release is recor ded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release
could  vary based on our assessment of all available evidence.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (8, 877) $ (1,287)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,665) $ (5,479)
Our investm ent policy requires the purchase of high-rated fixed income securities, the diversi fication of investment types a nd credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024  due to growth in revenue, partially
offset by higher tax paym ents. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2025 reflects the strong revenue growth, partially offse t
by $2.8 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal  year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of
marketable securities, and acquisition of land and buildings.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared  to the first half of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 28, 2024, we
had $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liqui dity to meet our operating requirements for at least
the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our  liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-he ld equity securities,  debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by hig hly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt
securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Co nsolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
31Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable se curities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities held outside the U.S.
as of July 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Payment from customers, per our standard paym ent term s, is generally due shortly after delivery  of products, availability of software licenses or commencement
of services.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the second quarter and first half of fisca l year 2025, we paid $246 million and $344 million, respectively , in quarterly cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our  Board of Directors' continuing determination that the
dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On June 7, 2024, we increased our qua rterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024. Our
quarterly cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024.
During the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and
$15.1 billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were authorized, su bject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock. On
August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approve d an additional $50.0 billion to our share repurchase authoriz ation, without expiration. As of August 26, 2024, a
total of $53.9 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while main taining
adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment
opportunities. W e plan to continue share repu rchases this fiscal year .
From April 29, 2024 through August 26, 2024, we repurchased 31.5 million shares for $3.6 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The U.S. Inflation Reduc tion Act of  2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost a nd was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $186 million recorded in non-current income tax p ayable as of
July 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability , interest payme nts, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the
underlying income tax  positions and the timing of
32the ef fective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the cont ractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations

foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 20 24.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of July 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
i nformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and f orms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions reg arding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or ar e reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update  much of
our existing core financia l systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will
occur in phases. W e will cont inue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ  ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control sys tem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must re flect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation o f controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.
33Part II. Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Pa rt I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “L egal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk facto rs liste d below , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A  of our  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA  common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Ite m 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024, and below . Any
one of  those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends  and uncertainties not present ly known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
Long manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply an d component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,
has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and asse mb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component
or capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a  quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in  both product shortages and
excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advanc e of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments f or capacity to address our business needs, or our
long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary fo r the
finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited  supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 m onths. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scal e their capabilities to meet
our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply
commitments at th e same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our pr oducts,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
 •competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•changes in business and economic conditions;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues ;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting  in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end-use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products;
•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated computing,  AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
34•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products; or
•government a ctions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
We continue to increase our supply and capacit y purchases with existing and new supplier s to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have
also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.  The increased purchase
volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with
variations in productio n planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to
increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incu r inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments
exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may cha nge or may not be correct, as we have
experienced in the past.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare  to ship and support
new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.
The computing industr y is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center arc hitectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year
and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the la rger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating
product transi tions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in
our revenue . We have experienced and may in the fut ure experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate
transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and f uture architecture transitions. If we are unable to
execute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and comp lexity of
newly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other
costs or result in produc t delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory pro visions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the
future.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product road map may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may  not be
able to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple pro duct archit ectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customer s often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through
multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by o ur multiple OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have
impacted and c ould in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various
downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers'  future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely  basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be
able to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient sup ply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill
our custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputa tion
could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any
one component have had and may  have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able  to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have imple mented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a  result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and rec orded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of
our historical  lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of
35these impac ts has increased and may continue  to increase as our purchase obligations an d prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and
become a greater portion of our total supply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Demand  estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to
generate significant revenue from them. Recent   technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for
Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multi ple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with
any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
Challenges  in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natur al disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,  contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed a nd marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future
impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, se veral years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to
be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact  of
cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price change s in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in
the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the futu re impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further
impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not  limited to, the Ethereum 2.0
merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sale s of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or
previously sold products may be resold online or on the unau thorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and
reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.
Additionally , we depend  on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publi shers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by
developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our p latforms, or failure by third-party content providers
or publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adverse ly affect
customer demand.
We receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to
customers who purchase directly or  indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of
these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited numb er of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to direct Customers, A, B,
C and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal  year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to
the Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio throug h their
channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. We have a small number of  partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly
complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key custome rs. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their
ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to custome rs. In the future, these
partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.
Because most of  our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little
notice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or custome rs may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and
our partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our pr oducts, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’
purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,  distributors
and other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators
and distributors, includin g through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &
Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supp ly availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors
and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amoun t of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them,
36our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to whic h our business is subject, and political and other actions may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas inclu ding, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; impor t and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreig n exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; data priva cy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and s afety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,  and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to
manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not  violate applicable laws
or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions
against us,  our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations
to which we are subject, or changes to their inte rpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For  example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result
of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity v ulnerabilities and risks.
Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,
the United Ki ngdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Author ity collected information from us regarding our business and
competition in the graph ics card and cloud service provider marke t as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received
requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, a nd South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs,
our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions
on the hardw are, software, and system s used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June
2024 and will be implemented in phases betwee n now and 2030. The State of Calif ornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions
under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, d elay or halt deployment of new systems
using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or
regulation s or their interpretation and enforceme nt could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or  exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our
shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in  the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our
business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security polic ies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sa nctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with  entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligation s and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation oc curred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial co ndition.
For example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, s ervices and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukr aine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that ta rget products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.
Concerns regardin g third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the f uture result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and c ould in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our busines s and financial results.
37Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.
As ge opolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export
control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in t he U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to Chi na, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively a nd materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be furthe r tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvanta ge for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream use rs of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our  cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end custom ers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gam ing products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less  likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impactin g our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial  results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to inclu de deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restric tions may not only impact our ability to serve
overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide  our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our
sales and efforts to supply the China m arket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators
conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any app licable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions
on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating  results and financial condition.
During the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and
supercompu ting industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including  Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing r equirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circu its. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second qu arter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countr ies in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Group s D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A80 0, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate par ent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H80 0, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validatio n, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distri bution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for
which the USG does not require a  license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing
requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing  process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a
license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved,  it may impose burdensome conditions that
we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that
38does not have clear standard s or an opportunity  for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for
exports of products to customers in China. The license process for e xports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions
that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements  have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new 
restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive
position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the
geographic,  customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we
are unable to provide contractual warranty or othe r extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to
significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants an y requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose
burdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certa in of our competitors,
as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to
pursue alternatives  to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may aga in change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial resu lts. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively exclu ding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms t o create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions su ch as requiring chip tracking and throttling
mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has
a lready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a
significant portion of our supply and dis tribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export co ntrols may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to
those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our product s, which are warehoused in and distributed
from Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in serve rs
containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large cluster s for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competit ors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions t o “design-out” certain
U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or
shifting export contr ols have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our
competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our busin ess, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls
may negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets , such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is  ready for
market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,
which would be less likely t o be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and i ncreased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or  any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the
Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products mad e by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another
example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per
memory  bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way
that effectively prevents us from being able to de sign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center
products and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating result s and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the
products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
39Finally , our business depends on our abi lity to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or serv ices from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.

1. General.
(a )Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation
1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 199 8 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation
2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Followi ng the
Effective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the
terms of this Plan except as follows: from the  Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company
anticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Empl oyees, Directors or Consultants who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan
covering up to an aggrega te of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign
nationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Fo reign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all
of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that
t he issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of
shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards grant ed following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign
Transition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for  issuance under this Plan as
provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that
expire or terminate for any reaso n prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for
issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in th is Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted
under the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
(b)Eligible Award Re cipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (i i) Nonstatutory Stock Options,
(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance
Cash Awards, and (viii)  Other Stock Awards.(d)Purpose. The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive
Awards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide i ncentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any
Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit fr om increases in value of the Common
Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to  “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant
to the transition relief provided by the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in
effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by  the Board, in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.
2. Administration.
(a)Administration by Board.  The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b)Powers of Board. The Board will have th e power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (B)  when and how each
Award will be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not
be identical), including the time or t imes when a person will be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; (E) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and (F) the Fair Ma rket Value applicable to a Stock Award.
(ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its
administration. The Board,  in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award
Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to th e extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the
Plan or Award fully effective.
(iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iv) To accelerate the time at  which an Award may be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it m ay be exercised or the time during which it
will vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Plan to the c ontrary, the time at which a Participant’s Award may be exercised or the time during which a Participant’s Award or any part thereof
will vest may only be accelerated in the event of the Participant’s  death or Disability or in the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement,  suspension or
termination of the Plan will not materially impair a Participant’s rights under his or her then-outstanding Award without his or her written consent.
(vi) To amend the Plan in any respec t the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive
Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bri ng the Plan or Awards granted under
the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section 9(a) relating to
Capitalization Ad justments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) mat erially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at w hich shares of Common
Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) materially expands the types of Awards
available for issuance under the Plan , but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
the Plan or an AwardAgreement, rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan  will not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless
(i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing.
(vii) To submit any  amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereu nder regarding the exclusion of performance-based
compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding
Incentive Sto ck Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
(viii) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including,
but not limited to, amendments to provi de terms more favorable than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits
in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided however, that, except with respe ct to amendments that disqualify or impair the
status of an Incentive Stock Option or as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, the rights under any Award will not be
materially impaire d by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant
consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitation s of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participant’s
consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary (A) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as a n
Incentive Stock Option, (B) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
the related guidance thereunder, or (C) to comply with o ther applicable laws.
(ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best
interests of the Company and that are not in confli ct with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
(x) To adopt such procedures or terms and sub-plans (none of which will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan) as are
necessary or desirable to  permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or
employed or located outside the United States.
(c)Delegation to Committee.
(i) Genera l. The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration
of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection  with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore
possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of
 the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee
or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions,  not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by
the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan  with the Committee and may, at
any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.
(ii) Section 162(m) and Rule 16b-3 Compliance. The Committee may consist solely of two or  more Outside Directors, in
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3. In addition, the
Board or the Committee, in its s ole discretion, may (A) delegate to a Committee who need not be Outside Directors the authority to grant Awards
to eligible persons who are either (I) not then Covered Employees and are not expected t o be Covered Employees at the time of recognition of
income resulting from such Stock Award, or (II) not persons with respect to whom the Company wishes to comply with Section 162(m) of the
Code, and/ or (B) delegate to a Committee who need not be Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Stock Awards to eligible persons who
are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
(d)Delegation  to Other Person or Body. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more persons or bodies the authority to do
one or more of the following to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) design ate recipients, other than Officers, of Stock Awards, provided that
no person or body may be delegated authority to grant a Stock Award to themself; (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock  subject
to such Stock Awards; and(iii) determine the terms of such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Board or Committee action regarding such delegation will fix the
terms of such delegation  in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation Sections 152 and 157 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Unless provided otherwise in the Board or Committee action regarding such  delegation, each Stock Award granted pursuant to
this section will be granted on the applicable form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee,
with any mod ifications necessary to incorporate or reflect the terms of such Stock Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2(d), neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to any per son or body (who is not a Director or that is not comprised solely of Directors,
respectively) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 13(x)(iii) below.
(e)Effect of Board ’s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(f)Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards. Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise
or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation  Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancel any outstanding Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash o r other Stock
Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.
(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Divide nds or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the applicable Award Agr eement; provided,
however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested
under the terms of such Award Agreement, (i i) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of such Award Ag reement (including, but not limited to, any
vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to the
Company on t he date, if any, such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to meet any vesting conditions under
the terms of such Award Agreement.
3.Shares Subject to the Plan.
(a)Sh are Reserve. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards  after the Effective Date will not exceed 10,289,710,640 shares
(the “2007 Plan Reserve”). Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) 152,767,766 shares, which is the total
re serve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the
shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans on t he Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000
shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Mee ting of
Stockholders), (iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 shares that
were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting o f Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockho lders, (vii)
733,103,298 shares that were added to reflect a 4-for-1 stock split effective July 19, 2021, (viii) 51,500,000 shares that were approved at the
Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholde rs, and (ix) 9,260,739,576 shares that were added to reflect a 10-for-1 stock split effective June
7, 2024. For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number of sha res of Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a). Shares may
be issued in conn ection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule,  and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares
available for issuance under the Plan.
 The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 s tock split effective September 10, 2007.1
1(b)Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve.
(i) Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise te rminate, in
whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at thei r original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Company’s reacquisition or repurchase
rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or  condition required for the vesting of
such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or
repurchased by the Comp any, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participan t
because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award (including any shares subject to a
Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant beca use the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock
Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in s hares of Common Stock, the
number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under
the Plan. If any shares subjec t to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in
satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number  of shares that are not delivered to the Participant
shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise or purchase price of any Stock Award, or the withholding of
taxes  incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual
delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered s hall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares
of Common Stock are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of  a Stock Award,
then the number of shares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(c)Incentive Stock Option Limit. Subject to the 2007 Plan Reserve and the pr ovisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options under the  Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) will be 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
(d)Individual Award Limitations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relati ng to Capitalization Adjustments, no Participant will be
eligible to be granted during any fiscal year:
(i) Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by refer ence to an increase over an
exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more
than 80,000,000 shares of Comm on Stock;
(ii) Performance Stock Awards covering more than 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and
(iii) Performance Cash Awards with a value of more than $6,000,000.
If a Performance Stock Award is in  the form of an Option, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award limit. If a Performance
Stock Award could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award lim it.
(e)Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including
shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or other wise.
4.Eligibility.
(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a “parent
corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as  such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than
Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, that Stoc k Awards may not be granted to
Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Rule 405 of the SecuritiesAct,  unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under Section 409A of the Code (for example,
because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate tran saction such as a spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in connection with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) the  Company, in
connection with its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent S tockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such
Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Optio n is not exercisable after the
expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c)Consultants. A Consultant will be eligible for the grant of an Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Re gistration Statement
under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (“Form S-8”) is available to register either the offer or the sale of
the Company’s securities to  such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the
Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of For m S-8.
5.Provisions Relating to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board will deem appropriate. All Option s will be
separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate
certificate or certificates will be issued for s hares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically
designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option  but some portion or all of the Option fails to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The
provision s of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Agreement will include (through incorporation
of provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherw ise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the
expiratio n of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement (the “Expiration Date”).
(b)Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding T en Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the
Award Agreement to the contrary, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value subject to  the
Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike
price lower than the Fair Market Value subject to the Awar d if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option
or stock appreciation right in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A and, if applicable, Secti on 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.
(c)Consideration. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be p aid, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.
The Board will have the authority to  grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to
use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to uti lize a particular method of payment. The methods of
payment permitted by this Section 5(c) are:
(i) by cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer payable to the Company;
(ii) pu rsuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance
of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or c heck) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay
the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;(iii) if an option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a “net  exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not 
exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent
of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise pric e not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided,
further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable t hereafter to the extent that (A)
shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as
a result of such exe rcise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Ag reement.
(d)Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the
Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Apprec iation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution
payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value  (on the date of
the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is
vested under such SAR, and with respect to w hich the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price. The appreciation
distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other fo rm of consideration, as determined by the
Board and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.
(e)Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such lim itations on the transferability of Options
and SARs as the Board will determine. If the Board determines that an Option or SAR will be transferable, the Option or SAR will contain such
additional term s and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the
following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or
pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below) and will be exercisa ble during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner consistent with appl icable tax and securities
laws upon the Participant’s request. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.
(ii) Domestic Relations Orders. N otwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or official marital settleme nt agreement; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoi ng, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a
Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company (o r the designated
broker), designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and
receive the Common Stock or other con sideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or
administrator of the Participant’s estate (or other party legally entitled to the Option or SAR proceeds)  will be entitled to exercise the Option or
SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a
beneficiary at any  time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of
applicable laws or difficult to administer.
(f)Vesting Generally. The total numb er of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become
exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other  terms and conditions on the
time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board
may deem appropriate. The ve sting provisions ofindividual Options or SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then the  Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service.
The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing th e minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to
which an Option or SAR may be exercised.
(g)Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other  agreement between
the Participant and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant’s
death or Disability), the Participant  may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award
as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time  ending on the earlier of (i) the date 90 days following the
termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agree ment. If,
after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the
Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or  SAR will terminate.
(h)Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service
(other than for Cause or upon the Participan t’s death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of
Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the  Participant to short-swing liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act due to a transaction engaged in by the Participant prior to his or her termination of Continuous Service, then
the Option o r SAR will terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of 90 days after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous
Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not  be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the
Participant to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Optio n or SAR as set forth in
the Award Agreement. All determinations under this Section 5(h) will be made in the sole discretion of the Board.
(i)Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in  the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant
and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s Disability,  the Participant may
exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service), but only wi thin such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous
Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the A ward Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service,
the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the  Option
or SAR will terminate.
(j)Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and
the Company, in the event that (i)  a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s death (which termination event
will give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), or (ii) the  Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the
Award Agreement after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event will not give ris e to
acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled
to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of d eath) by the Participant’s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or
SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participa nt’s death, but only within the period
ending on the earlier of (A) the date 18 months following the date of death, or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in
the Award Ag reement. If, after the Participant’s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR will terminate.
(k)Terminat ion for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant’s Award Agreement, or other individual written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Particip ant’s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or
SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant’s termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will be prohibited from ex ercising
his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.(l)Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for p urposes of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of
grant of the Option or SAR (al though the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Corporat e Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed,
continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the
Parti cipant’s Award Agreement or in another agreement between the Participant and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with
the Company’s then current employment policies and guidelines),  the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six
(6) months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non- exempt employee in
connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or
required for compliance with the Worke r Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection
with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from  the employee’s regular rate of pay, the
provisions of this Section 5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.
6.Provisions of Stock  Awards other than Options and SARs.
(a)Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as
the Board will deem appropriat e. To the extent consistent with the Company’s Bylaws, at the Board’s election, shares of Common Stock may be
(x) held in book entry form subject to the Company’s instructions until any restrictions r elating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or
(y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of
Restricte d Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award
Agreements need not be identical, provided, however, that each Restricted Stock A ward Agreement will include (through incorporation of the
provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(i) Consideration. A Re stricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft, money order or
electronic funds transfer payable to the Company, (B) past services rendered to the Company or an A ffiliate, or (C) any other form of legal
consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. Shar es of Common Stock awarded under a Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the
Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board; provided, however,  that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s
Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Award will become fully vested as of the date of
termination of  Continuous Service.
(iii) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates, the Company
may receive via a forfeiture condition or a repurcha se right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not
vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreem ent.
(iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by
the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set fo rth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board will determine in its
sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms  of the Restricted
Stock Award Agreement.
(b)Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will  deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to
time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need  not be identical, provided, however, that each
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement willinclude (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the s ubstance of each of the following
provisions:
(i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be
paid by the Participan t upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if
any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricte d Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration
that may be acceptable to the Board in its sole discretion and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. At the time of the gran t of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions or conditions to the
vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate; provided, h owever, that in all cases, in the event a
Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Unit Award will become fully vested as of
the date of t ermination of Continuous Service.
(iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any
combination thereof or in any other  form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreement.
(iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, t he Board, as it deems appropriate, may
impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted
Stock Unit Award  to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.
(v) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreeme nt, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant’s termination of Continuous
Service.
(c)Performance Awards.
(i) Performance Stock Awards.  A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest
or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals.  A Performance Stock Award may
require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his
or her death, then the P erformance Stock Award will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of the target level of performance, will be fully
vested, as of the date of death, and shares thereunder will be issued promptly follo wing the date of death. The length of any Performance
Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such
Performance Goals h ave been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to the extent that an Award is not intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the  Board), in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that cash may be
us ed in payment of Performance Stock Awards.
(ii) Performance Cash Awards. A Performance Cash Award is a cash award that is payable contingent upon the attainment during
a Performance Period of certain  Performance Goals. A Performance Cash Award may also require the completion of a specified period of
Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved duri ng the Performance Period, and the
measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to
the extent that an Award is  not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board), in its
sole discretion. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may provide for or, subject  to such terms and conditions as the Board or the
Committee, as applicable, may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Cash Award to be deferred to a
specified  date or event. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may specify the form of payment of Performance Cash Awards, which may
be cash or other property, or may provide for a Participant to have the  option for his or her Performance Cash Award, or such portion thereof as
the Board or theCommittee, as applicable, may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, t o the extent permitted by applicable
law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that Common Stock authorized under this
Plan may be used in paymen t of Performance Cash Awards, including additional shares in excess of the Performance Cash Award as an
inducement to hold shares of Common Stock.
(iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise per mitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code
with respect to any Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” thereunder, the Committee will establish the  Performance
Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after
the commencement of the applicable Performa nce Period, and (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in any
event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Pr ior to the payment of any
compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will
certify the extent to which any Perfo rmance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases
where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). With respect to any Awar d intended to qualify as “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due
upon the attainment of the a pplicable Performance Goals on the basis of any such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine.
(d)Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole  or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock,
including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and  the
preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including, but not limited to, Section 2(g)), the Board will have sole
and complete authority to determine the perso ns to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number
of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awar ds and all other terms and
conditions of such Other Stock Awards; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then  any Other Stock Awards held by such Participant will become fully vested as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service.
7.Covenants of the Company.
(a)Availability of Shares. During the terms o f the Stock Awards, the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of
Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
(b)Securities Law Compliance. The Company will s eek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the
Plan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue an d sell shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities
Act the Plan, any Stock Award or  any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if
the cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the ben efits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such
regulator y commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common
Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for f ailure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock
Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent iss uance of cash
or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.
(c)No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company will ha ve no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant
as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or othe rwise advise
such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has any duty or  obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award.8.Miscellaneous.
(a)Use of Proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will consti tute general funds of the Company.
(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed  as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually receiv ed or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
 exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate reco rds will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to ha ve any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
o f shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Se rvice Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any rig ht to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment  of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pur suant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisi ons of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commit ment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has  a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance wi th applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date o f such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the  Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the  time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds  $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according  to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option
Agree ment(s) or any Board or Committee resolutions related thereto.
(g)Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any
Award,  (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably sat isfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial
and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the me rits and risks of
exercising the Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock
subject to the Award for the Participant’ s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwisedistributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inope rative if (A)
the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award has been registered under a then currently
effective registration statement under the Securiti es Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws . The Company may, upon
advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with applicable se curities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.
(h)Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, i n its sole discretion, satisfy any
federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award (including but not limited to income tax, social insurance
contributions, payment on  account or any other taxes) by any of the following means (in addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate) or by a combina tion of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a
cash payment; (ii)  withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in
co nnection with the Award; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of
tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be  necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts  otherwise payable to the
Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.
(i)Electronic Delivery. Any reference herein to a “written” agreement or document will inc lude any agreement or document delivered
electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company’s intranet.
(j)Deferrals. To the extent permitted by  applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock
or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may  be deferred and may establish programs
and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code. Consistent  with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise
providing services to the Company or an Affiliate. The Board is authorized  to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual
percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant’s termination of Continuous S ervice,
and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.
(k)Compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly prov ided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will
be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 4 09A of
the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted
hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to  Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will
incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to th e extent an
Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan  (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common
Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” und er Section 409A of the Code is a
“specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation
from service” (as defined  in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date
that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation fro m service” or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless
such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred wil l be paid in
a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.(l)Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be su bject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the
Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Compa ny’s
securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In
addition, the Board may impose such other clawback,  recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines
necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of  Common Stock or other
cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause.
9.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Other Corporate Events.
(a)Capitalization Adjustments. In the event of a Capitalizatio n Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the
class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and maximum n umber of securities
that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section 3(c); (iii) the class(es) and maximum number of
securities that may be awarded to any per son pursuant to Section 3(d); and (iv) the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of
stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments, and its determinat ion will be final, binding and conclusive.
(b)Dissolution or Liquidation. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of
the Company, and up on ten (10) days prior written notice, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and
outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchas e or a forfeiture condition) will terminate immediately prior
to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company’s repurchase rights or a forfe iture
condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing
Continuous Service, provided, however, that the Board may, in  its sole discretion, cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested,
exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expire d or terminated)
before the dissolution or liquidation is completed but contingent on its completion.
(c)Corporate Transaction.
(i) Stock Awards May Be Assumed. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock  Award Agreement, in the event of a Corporate
Transaction, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation’s parent company) may assume or
continue any or  all Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or may substitute similar stock awards for Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan
(including but not limited to, awards to acquire the same consideration  paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Corporate
Transaction), and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Common Stock issued pursuant to Stock Award s
may be assigned by the Company to the successor of the Company (or the successor’s parent company, if any), in connection with such
Corporate Transaction. A surviving corporation or acquiring corpor ation (or its parent) may choose to assume or continue only a portion of a
Stock Award or substitute a similar stock award for only a portion of a Stock Award.
(ii) Stock Awards Not Assumed Held by Cu rrent Participants. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock Award Agreement
(including an option and stock award agreement subject to the terms of the Prior Plans, which terms remain applicable as to  outstanding options
and stock awards thereunder), in the event of a Corporate Transaction in which the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or its parent
company) does not assume or continu e any or all outstanding Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards for such outstanding Stock
Awards, then with respect to Stock Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and t hat are held by Participants whose
Continuous Service has not terminated prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction (referred to as the “Current Participants”), the

following events:
(i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company represent ing more than 50%
of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Cha nge in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by
an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Compa ny’s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, or (B) solely because

election) of any new Board member was approved orrecommended by a majority  vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered as a member of the Incumbent Board.
For purposes of determining voting p ower under the term Change in Control, voting power will be calculated by assuming the conversion of
all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote , but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or
right to subscribe to or purchase those shares. In addition, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other
transac tion effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any
analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Co mpany or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing

is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply; provided, further, that no Change in Control will be deemed
to occur upon announcement or co mmencement of a tender offer or upon a potential takeover or upon stockholder approval of a merger or other
transaction, in each case without a requirement that the Change in Control actually occur.
I f required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such
transaction is not also a “change in the ownership or effective control  of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of
the assets of” the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative  definition
thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s consent, amend the definition of “Change in Control” to conform to
the definition of “Change in Control” under  Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(h)“Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.
(i)“Committee” me ans a committee of one (1) or more Directors to whom authority has been delegated by the Board in accordance with
Section 2(c).

Compute & Networking revenue – The increa se in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2024 was due to strengt h in Data Center computing and networking for accelerat ed computing and AI solutions. Revenue from GPU computing grew 166% year-
on-year and 257% compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU architecture computin g platform for training and
inferencing of large language models, recomm endation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was also up 114% year-on-year and 159%
compared to the first half  of last year driven by both InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue.
28Graphics revenue  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first  half of fiscal year 2024 was led
by higher sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compa red to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2024 in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.
All Other operating loss – The incre ase in the second  quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024
was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and c ompensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises  and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal year 2025, r espectively , and 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively .
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct cus tomers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integ rators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal re sources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service provide rs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Comp ute & Networking segment, are
presented in the following table:
 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended
 Jul 28, 2024 Jul 28, 2024
Customer A 14 % 14 %
Customer B 11 % *
Customer C 11 % *
Customer D 10 %  10 %
Customer E * 10 %
* Less than 10% of total revenue
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distrib utors, including
through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represent 10% or more of total revenue attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
For the first half of fiscal year 202 5, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products from system integrators and distributors, including from
Customer E, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable  to the Compute & Networking segment.
Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data
 and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may dif fer from our estimates.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,  and this trend may continue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.
Our overall gross margi n increased to 75.1% and 76.6% for the second quart er and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , from 70.1% and 68.2% for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The increases in the second quarter and first half  of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 154% and 234% for the second quarter and first half of
 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively ,  and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 millio n and $199 million for the second quarter  and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively . The net effect on
our
29gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $576 million and $709 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal  year 2024,
respectively . Sales of previously reserved invent ory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $84 million and
$134 million  for the seco nd quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 3.6% and
2.8% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, re spectively .
We expect our Data Center mix to continue to shift to new products in the second half of fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in
the mid-70% range.

of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other , net, compared to the second quarter and first half of fis cal year 2024 was primarily driven by an
increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statem ents in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity
securities.
30Income T axes
We recognized i ncome tax expense of $2.6 billion and $5.0 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and $793 million and
$958 million for the second quarter and first half of  fiscal year 2024, respectively . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.6%
and 13.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and 11.4%  and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,
respectively .
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intang ible income deduction relative to the increase
in income before income tax.
Given our current and anticipated future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation  allowance associated with c ertain state deferred tax assets in
the near term, which would decrease our income  tax expense for the period the release is recor ded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release
could  vary based on our assessment of all available evidence.

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 29,833 $ 9,259 
Net cash used in investing activities $ (8, 877) $ (1,287)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,665) $ (5,479)
Our investm ent policy requires the purchase of high-rated fixed income securities, the diversi fication of investment types a nd credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024  due to growth in revenue, partially
offset by higher tax paym ents. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2025 reflects the strong revenue growth, partially offse t
by $2.8 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal  year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of
marketable securities, and acquisition of land and buildings.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared  to the first half of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 28, 2024, we
had $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liqui dity to meet our operating requirements for at least
the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our  liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-he ld equity securities,  debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by hig hly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt
securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Co nsolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
31Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable se curities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities held outside the U.S.
as of July 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Payment from customers, per our standard paym ent term s, is generally due shortly after delivery  of products, availability of software licenses or commencement
of services.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the second quarter and first half of fisca l year 2025, we paid $246 million and $344 million, respectively , in quarterly cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our  Board of Directors' continuing determination that the
dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On June 7, 2024, we increased our qua rterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024. Our
quarterly cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024.
During the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and
$15.1 billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were authorized, su bject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock. On
August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approve d an additional $50.0 billion to our share repurchase authoriz ation, without expiration. As of August 26, 2024, a
total of $53.9 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while main taining
adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment
opportunities. W e plan to continue share repu rchases this fiscal year .
From April 29, 2024 through August 26, 2024, we repurchased 31.5 million shares for $3.6 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The U.S. Inflation Reduc tion Act of  2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost a nd was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $186 million recorded in non-current income tax p ayable as of
July 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability , interest payme nts, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the
underlying income tax  positions and the timing of
32the ef fective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the cont ractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations
from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for th e fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report o n Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024
for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations,  refer to Notes 2,
11, and 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively .
Climate Change
To date, there has been  no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing
renewable energy or climate-related business trends.
Adoption of New  and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
There has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
I nvestment and Interest Rate Risk
Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”
in  our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. As of July 28, 2024, there have been no material changes to the financial market
risks described as of January 28, 2024.
Fore ign Exchange Rate Risk
The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk”  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. As of July 28, 2024, there have been no material changes to the
foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 20 24.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of July 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
i nformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and f orms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions reg arding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or ar e reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update  much of
our existing core financia l systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will
occur in phases. W e will cont inue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ  ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control sys tem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must re flect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation o f controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.
33Part II. Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Pa rt I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “L egal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk facto rs liste d below , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A  of our  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA  common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Ite m 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024, and below . Any
one of  those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends  and uncertainties not present ly known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
Long manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply an d component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,
has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and asse mb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component
or capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a  quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in  both product shortages and
excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advanc e of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments f or capacity to address our business needs, or our
long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary fo r the
finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited  supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 m onths. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scal e their capabilities to meet
our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply
commitments at th e same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our pr oducts,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
 •competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•changes in business and economic conditions;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues ;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting  in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end-use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products;
•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated computing,  AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
34•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products; or
•government a ctions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
We continue to increase our supply and capacit y purchases with existing and new supplier s to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have
also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.  The increased purchase
volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with
variations in productio n planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to
increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incu r inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments
exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may cha nge or may not be correct, as we have
experienced in the past.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare  to ship and support
new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.
The computing industr y is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center arc hitectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year
and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the la rger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating
product transi tions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in
our revenue . We have experienced and may in the fut ure experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate
transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and f uture architecture transitions. If we are unable to
execute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and comp lexity of
newly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other
costs or result in produc t delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory pro visions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the
future.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product road map may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may  not be
able to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple pro duct archit ectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customer s often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through
multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by o ur multiple OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have
impacted and c ould in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various
downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers'  future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely  basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be
able to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient sup ply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill
our custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputa tion
could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any
one component have had and may  have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able  to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have imple mented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a  result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and rec orded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of
our historical  lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of
35these impac ts has increased and may continue  to increase as our purchase obligations an d prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and
become a greater portion of our total supply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Demand  estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to
generate significant revenue from them. Recent   technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for
Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multi ple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with
any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
Challenges  in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natur al disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,  contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed a nd marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future
impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, se veral years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to
be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact  of
cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price change s in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in
the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the futu re impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further
impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not  limited to, the Ethereum 2.0
merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sale s of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or
previously sold products may be resold online or on the unau thorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and
reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.
Additionally , we depend  on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publi shers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by
developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our p latforms, or failure by third-party content providers
or publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adverse ly affect
customer demand.
We receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to
customers who purchase directly or  indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of
these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited numb er of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to direct Customers, A, B,
C and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal  year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to
the Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio throug h their
channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. We have a small number of  partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly
complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key custome rs. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their
ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to custome rs. In the future, these
partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.
Because most of  our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little
notice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or custome rs may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and
our partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our pr oducts, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’
purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,  distributors
and other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators
and distributors, includin g through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &
Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supp ly availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors
and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amoun t of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them,
36our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to whic h our business is subject, and political and other actions may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas inclu ding, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; impor t and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreig n exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; data priva cy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and s afety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,  and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to
manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not  violate applicable laws
or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions
against us,  our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations
to which we are subject, or changes to their inte rpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For  example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result
of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity v ulnerabilities and risks.
Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,
the United Ki ngdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Author ity collected information from us regarding our business and
competition in the graph ics card and cloud service provider marke t as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received
requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, a nd South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs,
our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions
on the hardw are, software, and system s used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June
2024 and will be implemented in phases betwee n now and 2030. The State of Calif ornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions
under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, d elay or halt deployment of new systems
using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or
regulation s or their interpretation and enforceme nt could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or  exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our
shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in  the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our
business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security polic ies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sa nctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with  entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligation s and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation oc curred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial co ndition.
For example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, s ervices and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukr aine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that ta rget products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.
Concerns regardin g third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the f uture result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and c ould in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our busines s and financial results.
37Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.
As ge opolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export
control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in t he U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to Chi na, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively a nd materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be furthe r tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvanta ge for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream use rs of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our  cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end custom ers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gam ing products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less  likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impactin g our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial  results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to inclu de deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restric tions may not only impact our ability to serve
overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide  our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our
sales and efforts to supply the China m arket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators
conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any app licable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions
on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating  results and financial condition.
During the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and
supercompu ting industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including  Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing r equirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circu its. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second qu arter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countr ies in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Group s D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A80 0, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate par ent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H80 0, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validatio n, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distri bution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for
which the USG does not require a  license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing
requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing  process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a
license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved,  it may impose burdensome conditions that
we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that
38does not have clear standard s or an opportunity  for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for
exports of products to customers in China. The license process for e xports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions
that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements  have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new 
restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive
position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the
geographic,  customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we
are unable to provide contractual warranty or othe r extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to
significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants an y requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose
burdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certa in of our competitors,
as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to
pursue alternatives  to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may aga in change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial resu lts. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively exclu ding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms t o create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions su ch as requiring chip tracking and throttling
mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has
a lready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a
significant portion of our supply and dis tribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export co ntrols may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to
those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our product s, which are warehoused in and distributed
from Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in serve rs
containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large cluster s for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competit ors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions t o “design-out” certain
U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or
shifting export contr ols have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our
competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our busin ess, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls
may negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets , such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is  ready for
market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,
which would be less likely t o be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and i ncreased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or  any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the
Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products mad e by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another
example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per
memory  bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way
that effectively prevents us from being able to de sign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center
products and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating result s and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the
products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
39Finally , our business depends on our abi lity to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or serv ices from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.

1. General.
(a )Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation
1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 199 8 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation
2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Followi ng the
Effective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the
terms of this Plan except as follows: from the  Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company
anticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Empl oyees, Directors or Consultants who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan
covering up to an aggrega te of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign
nationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Fo reign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all
of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that
t he issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of
shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards grant ed following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign
Transition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for  issuance under this Plan as
provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that
expire or terminate for any reaso n prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for
issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in th is Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted
under the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
(b)Eligible Award Re cipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (i i) Nonstatutory Stock Options,
(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance
Cash Awards, and (viii)  Other Stock Awards.(d)Purpose. The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive
Awards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide i ncentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any
Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit fr om increases in value of the Common
Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to  “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant
to the transition relief provided by the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in
effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by  the Board, in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.
2. Administration.
(a)Administration by Board.  The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b)Powers of Board. The Board will have th e power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (B)  when and how each
Award will be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not
be identical), including the time or t imes when a person will be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; (E) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and (F) the Fair Ma rket Value applicable to a Stock Award.
(ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its
administration. The Board,  in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award
Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to th e extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the
Plan or Award fully effective.
(iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iv) To accelerate the time at  which an Award may be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it m ay be exercised or the time during which it
will vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Plan to the c ontrary, the time at which a Participant’s Award may be exercised or the time during which a Participant’s Award or any part thereof
will vest may only be accelerated in the event of the Participant’s  death or Disability or in the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement,  suspension or
termination of the Plan will not materially impair a Participant’s rights under his or her then-outstanding Award without his or her written consent.
(vi) To amend the Plan in any respec t the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive
Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bri ng the Plan or Awards granted under
the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section 9(a) relating to
Capitalization Ad justments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) mat erially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at w hich shares of Common
Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) materially expands the types of Awards
available for issuance under the Plan , but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
the Plan or an AwardAgreement, rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan  will not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless
(i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing.
(vii) To submit any  amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereu nder regarding the exclusion of performance-based
compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding
Incentive Sto ck Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
(viii) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including,
but not limited to, amendments to provi de terms more favorable than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits
in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided however, that, except with respe ct to amendments that disqualify or impair the
status of an Incentive Stock Option or as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, the rights under any Award will not be
materially impaire d by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant
consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitation s of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participant’s
consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary (A) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as a n
Incentive Stock Option, (B) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
the related guidance thereunder, or (C) to comply with o ther applicable laws.
(ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best
interests of the Company and that are not in confli ct with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
(x) To adopt such procedures or terms and sub-plans (none of which will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan) as are
necessary or desirable to  permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or
employed or located outside the United States.
(c)Delegation to Committee.
(i) Genera l. The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration
of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection  with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore
possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of
 the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee
or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions,  not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by
the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan  with the Committee and may, at
any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.
(ii) Section 162(m) and Rule 16b-3 Compliance. The Committee may consist solely of two or  more Outside Directors, in
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3. In addition, the
Board or the Committee, in its s ole discretion, may (A) delegate to a Committee who need not be Outside Directors the authority to grant Awards
to eligible persons who are either (I) not then Covered Employees and are not expected t o be Covered Employees at the time of recognition of
income resulting from such Stock Award, or (II) not persons with respect to whom the Company wishes to comply with Section 162(m) of the
Code, and/ or (B) delegate to a Committee who need not be Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Stock Awards to eligible persons who
are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
(d)Delegation  to Other Person or Body. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more persons or bodies the authority to do
one or more of the following to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) design ate recipients, other than Officers, of Stock Awards, provided that
no person or body may be delegated authority to grant a Stock Award to themself; (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock  subject
to such Stock Awards; and(iii) determine the terms of such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Board or Committee action regarding such delegation will fix the
terms of such delegation  in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation Sections 152 and 157 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Unless provided otherwise in the Board or Committee action regarding such  delegation, each Stock Award granted pursuant to
this section will be granted on the applicable form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee,
with any mod ifications necessary to incorporate or reflect the terms of such Stock Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2(d), neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to any per son or body (who is not a Director or that is not comprised solely of Directors,
respectively) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 13(x)(iii) below.
(e)Effect of Board ’s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(f)Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards. Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise
or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation  Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancel any outstanding Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash o r other Stock
Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.
(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Divide nds or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the applicable Award Agr eement; provided,
however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested
under the terms of such Award Agreement, (i i) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of such Award Ag reement (including, but not limited to, any
vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to the
Company on t he date, if any, such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to meet any vesting conditions under
the terms of such Award Agreement.
3.Shares Subject to the Plan.
(a)Sh are Reserve. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards  after the Effective Date will not exceed 10,289,710,640 shares
(the “2007 Plan Reserve”). Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) 152,767,766 shares, which is the total
re serve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the
shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans on t he Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000
shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Mee ting of
Stockholders), (iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 shares that
were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting o f Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockho lders, (vii)
733,103,298 shares that were added to reflect a 4-for-1 stock split effective July 19, 2021, (viii) 51,500,000 shares that were approved at the
Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholde rs, and (ix) 9,260,739,576 shares that were added to reflect a 10-for-1 stock split effective June
7, 2024. For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number of sha res of Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a). Shares may
be issued in conn ection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule,  and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares
available for issuance under the Plan.
 The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 s tock split effective September 10, 2007.1
1(b)Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve.
(i) Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise te rminate, in
whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at thei r original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Company’s reacquisition or repurchase
rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or  condition required for the vesting of
such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or
repurchased by the Comp any, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participan t
because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award (including any shares subject to a
Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant beca use the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock
Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in s hares of Common Stock, the
number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under
the Plan. If any shares subjec t to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in
satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number  of shares that are not delivered to the Participant
shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise or purchase price of any Stock Award, or the withholding of
taxes  incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual
delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered s hall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares
of Common Stock are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of  a Stock Award,
then the number of shares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(c)Incentive Stock Option Limit. Subject to the 2007 Plan Reserve and the pr ovisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options under the  Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) will be 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
(d)Individual Award Limitations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relati ng to Capitalization Adjustments, no Participant will be
eligible to be granted during any fiscal year:
(i) Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by refer ence to an increase over an
exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more
than 80,000,000 shares of Comm on Stock;
(ii) Performance Stock Awards covering more than 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and
(iii) Performance Cash Awards with a value of more than $6,000,000.
If a Performance Stock Award is in  the form of an Option, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award limit. If a Performance
Stock Award could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award lim it.
(e)Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including
shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or other wise.
4.Eligibility.
(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a “parent
corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as  such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than
Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, that Stoc k Awards may not be granted to
Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Rule 405 of the SecuritiesAct,  unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under Section 409A of the Code (for example,
because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate tran saction such as a spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in connection with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) the  Company, in
connection with its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent S tockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such
Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Optio n is not exercisable after the
expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c)Consultants. A Consultant will be eligible for the grant of an Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Re gistration Statement
under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (“Form S-8”) is available to register either the offer or the sale of
the Company’s securities to  such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the
Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of For m S-8.
5.Provisions Relating to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board will deem appropriate. All Option s will be
separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate
certificate or certificates will be issued for s hares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically
designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option  but some portion or all of the Option fails to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The
provision s of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Agreement will include (through incorporation
of provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherw ise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the
expiratio n of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement (the “Expiration Date”).
(b)Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding T en Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the
Award Agreement to the contrary, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value subject to  the
Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike
price lower than the Fair Market Value subject to the Awar d if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option
or stock appreciation right in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A and, if applicable, Secti on 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.
(c)Consideration. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be p aid, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.
The Board will have the authority to  grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to
use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to uti lize a particular method of payment. The methods of
payment permitted by this Section 5(c) are:
(i) by cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer payable to the Company;
(ii) pu rsuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance
of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or c heck) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay
the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;(iii) if an option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a “net  exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not 
exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent
of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise pric e not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided,
further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable t hereafter to the extent that (A)
shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as
a result of such exe rcise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Ag reement.
(d)Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the
Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Apprec iation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution
payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value  (on the date of
the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is
vested under such SAR, and with respect to w hich the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price. The appreciation
distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other fo rm of consideration, as determined by the
Board and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.
(e)Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such lim itations on the transferability of Options
and SARs as the Board will determine. If the Board determines that an Option or SAR will be transferable, the Option or SAR will contain such
additional term s and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the
following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or
pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below) and will be exercisa ble during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner consistent with appl icable tax and securities
laws upon the Participant’s request. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.
(ii) Domestic Relations Orders. N otwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or official marital settleme nt agreement; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoi ng, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a
Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company (o r the designated
broker), designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and
receive the Common Stock or other con sideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or
administrator of the Participant’s estate (or other party legally entitled to the Option or SAR proceeds)  will be entitled to exercise the Option or
SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a
beneficiary at any  time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of
applicable laws or difficult to administer.
(f)Vesting Generally. The total numb er of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become
exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other  terms and conditions on the
time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board
may deem appropriate. The ve sting provisions ofindividual Options or SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then the  Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service.
The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing th e minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to
which an Option or SAR may be exercised.
(g)Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other  agreement between
the Participant and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant’s
death or Disability), the Participant  may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award
as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time  ending on the earlier of (i) the date 90 days following the
termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agree ment. If,
after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the
Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or  SAR will terminate.
(h)Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service
(other than for Cause or upon the Participan t’s death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of
Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the  Participant to short-swing liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act due to a transaction engaged in by the Participant prior to his or her termination of Continuous Service, then
the Option o r SAR will terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of 90 days after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous
Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not  be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the
Participant to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Optio n or SAR as set forth in
the Award Agreement. All determinations under this Section 5(h) will be made in the sole discretion of the Board.
(i)Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in  the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant
and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s Disability,  the Participant may
exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service), but only wi thin such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous
Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the A ward Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service,
the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the  Option
or SAR will terminate.
(j)Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and
the Company, in the event that (i)  a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s death (which termination event
will give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), or (ii) the  Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the
Award Agreement after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event will not give ris e to
acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled
to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of d eath) by the Participant’s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or
SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participa nt’s death, but only within the period
ending on the earlier of (A) the date 18 months following the date of death, or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in
the Award Ag reement. If, after the Participant’s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR will terminate.
(k)Terminat ion for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant’s Award Agreement, or other individual written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Particip ant’s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or
SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant’s termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will be prohibited from ex ercising
his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.(l)Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for p urposes of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of
grant of the Option or SAR (al though the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Corporat e Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed,
continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the
Parti cipant’s Award Agreement or in another agreement between the Participant and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with
the Company’s then current employment policies and guidelines),  the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six
(6) months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non- exempt employee in
connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or
required for compliance with the Worke r Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection
with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from  the employee’s regular rate of pay, the
provisions of this Section 5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.
6.Provisions of Stock  Awards other than Options and SARs.
(a)Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as
the Board will deem appropriat e. To the extent consistent with the Company’s Bylaws, at the Board’s election, shares of Common Stock may be
(x) held in book entry form subject to the Company’s instructions until any restrictions r elating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or
(y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of
Restricte d Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award
Agreements need not be identical, provided, however, that each Restricted Stock A ward Agreement will include (through incorporation of the
provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(i) Consideration. A Re stricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft, money order or
electronic funds transfer payable to the Company, (B) past services rendered to the Company or an A ffiliate, or (C) any other form of legal
consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. Shar es of Common Stock awarded under a Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the
Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board; provided, however,  that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s
Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Award will become fully vested as of the date of
termination of  Continuous Service.
(iii) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates, the Company
may receive via a forfeiture condition or a repurcha se right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not
vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreem ent.
(iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by
the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set fo rth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board will determine in its
sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms  of the Restricted
Stock Award Agreement.
(b)Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will  deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to
time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need  not be identical, provided, however, that each
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement willinclude (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the s ubstance of each of the following
provisions:
(i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be
paid by the Participan t upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if
any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricte d Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration
that may be acceptable to the Board in its sole discretion and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. At the time of the gran t of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions or conditions to the
vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate; provided, h owever, that in all cases, in the event a
Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Unit Award will become fully vested as of
the date of t ermination of Continuous Service.
(iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any
combination thereof or in any other  form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreement.
(iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, t he Board, as it deems appropriate, may
impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted
Stock Unit Award  to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.
(v) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreeme nt, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant’s termination of Continuous
Service.
(c)Performance Awards.
(i) Performance Stock Awards.  A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest
or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals.  A Performance Stock Award may
require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his
or her death, then the P erformance Stock Award will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of the target level of performance, will be fully
vested, as of the date of death, and shares thereunder will be issued promptly follo wing the date of death. The length of any Performance
Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such
Performance Goals h ave been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to the extent that an Award is not intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the  Board), in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that cash may be
us ed in payment of Performance Stock Awards.
(ii) Performance Cash Awards. A Performance Cash Award is a cash award that is payable contingent upon the attainment during
a Performance Period of certain  Performance Goals. A Performance Cash Award may also require the completion of a specified period of
Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved duri ng the Performance Period, and the
measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to
the extent that an Award is  not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board), in its
sole discretion. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may provide for or, subject  to such terms and conditions as the Board or the
Committee, as applicable, may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Cash Award to be deferred to a
specified  date or event. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may specify the form of payment of Performance Cash Awards, which may
be cash or other property, or may provide for a Participant to have the  option for his or her Performance Cash Award, or such portion thereof as
the Board or theCommittee, as applicable, may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, t o the extent permitted by applicable
law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that Common Stock authorized under this
Plan may be used in paymen t of Performance Cash Awards, including additional shares in excess of the Performance Cash Award as an
inducement to hold shares of Common Stock.
(iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise per mitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code
with respect to any Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” thereunder, the Committee will establish the  Performance
Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after
the commencement of the applicable Performa nce Period, and (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in any
event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Pr ior to the payment of any
compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will
certify the extent to which any Perfo rmance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases
where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). With respect to any Awar d intended to qualify as “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due
upon the attainment of the a pplicable Performance Goals on the basis of any such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine.
(d)Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole  or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock,
including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and  the
preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including, but not limited to, Section 2(g)), the Board will have sole
and complete authority to determine the perso ns to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number
of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awar ds and all other terms and
conditions of such Other Stock Awards; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then  any Other Stock Awards held by such Participant will become fully vested as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service.
7.Covenants of the Company.
(a)Availability of Shares. During the terms o f the Stock Awards, the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of
Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
(b)Securities Law Compliance. The Company will s eek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the
Plan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue an d sell shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities
Act the Plan, any Stock Award or  any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if
the cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the ben efits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such
regulator y commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common
Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for f ailure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock
Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent iss uance of cash
or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.
(c)No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company will ha ve no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant
as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or othe rwise advise
such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has any duty or  obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award.8.Miscellaneous.
(a)Use of Proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will consti tute general funds of the Company.
(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed  as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually receiv ed or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
 exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate reco rds will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to ha ve any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
o f shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Se rvice Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any rig ht to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment  of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pur suant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisi ons of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commit ment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has  a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance wi th applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date o f such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the  Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the  time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds  $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according  to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option
Agree ment(s) or any Board or Committee resolutions related thereto.
(g)Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any
Award,  (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably sat isfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial
and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the me rits and risks of
exercising the Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock
subject to the Award for the Participant’ s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwisedistributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inope rative if (A)
the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award has been registered under a then currently
effective registration statement under the Securiti es Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws . The Company may, upon
advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with applicable se curities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.
(h)Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, i n its sole discretion, satisfy any
federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award (including but not limited to income tax, social insurance
contributions, payment on  account or any other taxes) by any of the following means (in addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate) or by a combina tion of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a
cash payment; (ii)  withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in
co nnection with the Award; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of
tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be  necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts  otherwise payable to the
Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.
(i)Electronic Delivery. Any reference herein to a “written” agreement or document will inc lude any agreement or document delivered
electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company’s intranet.
(j)Deferrals. To the extent permitted by  applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock
or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may  be deferred and may establish programs
and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code. Consistent  with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise
providing services to the Company or an Affiliate. The Board is authorized  to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual
percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant’s termination of Continuous S ervice,
and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.
(k)Compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly prov ided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will
be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 4 09A of
the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted
hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to  Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will
incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to th e extent an
Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan  (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common
Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” und er Section 409A of the Code is a
“specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation
from service” (as defined  in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date
that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation fro m service” or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless
such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred wil l be paid in
a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.(l)Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be su bject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the
Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Compa ny’s
securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In
addition, the Board may impose such other clawback,  recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines
necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of  Common Stock or other
cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause.
9.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Other Corporate Events.

the Company, and up on ten (10) days prior written notice, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and
outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchas e or a forfeiture condition) will terminate immediately prior
to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company’s repurchase rights or a forfe iture
condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing
Continuous Service, provided, however, that the Board may, in  its sole discretion, cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested,
exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expire d or terminated)

Control, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquirin g corporation’s parent company) may assume or continue

(a)“Affiliate” means, at the time of determination, any “parent” or “subsidiary” of the Company as such terms are defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act. The Board will have the  authority to determine the time or times at which “parent” or “subsidiary” status is determined within the

(f)“Cause” means (i) if a Participant is party to an agreement with the Company or an Affiliate that relates to equity awards and contains a
definition of “Cause,” the definition of “Cause” in the a pplicable agreement, or (ii) if a Participant is not party to any such agreement, such

Participant as an Employee, Officer, Director or Consultant of the Company or an Affiliate, other than as a result of having a Disability, or a
breach  of any applicable invention assignment and confidentiality agreement or similar agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the
Participant, (D) the Participant’s disregard of the policies of th e Company or an Affiliate so as to cause loss, damage or injury to the property,

(g) “Change in Control” means the occurrence, in a single trans action or in a series of related transactions, of any one or more of the
following events:
(i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company represent ing more than 50%
of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Cha nge in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by
an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Compa ny’s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, or (B) solely because
 the level of Ownership held by any Exchange Act Person (the “Subject Person”) exceeds the designated percentage threshold of the
outstanding voting securities as a result of a repurchase or other acqu isition of voting securities by the Company reducing the number of shares

(ii) there is consummated a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving (directly or indirectly) the Company and,
immediately after the consummation of such merger, consolidation or  similar transaction, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
thereto do not Own, directly or indirectly, either (A) outstanding voting securities representing more than 50% of the combined  outstanding voting
power of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction or (B) more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power
of the parent of the surviving Entit y in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as
their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to s uch transaction;
(iii) there is consummated a sale, lease, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of

stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company
immediately prior to su ch sale, lease, license or other disposition; or
(iv) individuals who, on the date this Plan is adopted by the Board, are members of the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for
any reason to constitut e at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the appointment or election (or nomination for
election) of any new Board member was approved orrecommended by a majority  vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered as a member of the Incumbent Board.
For purposes of determining voting p ower under the term Change in Control, voting power will be calculated by assuming the conversion of
all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote , but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or
right to subscribe to or purchase those shares. In addition, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other
transac tion effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any
analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Co mpany or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing
definition with respect to Awards subject to such agreement; provided, however, that if no definition of Change in Control or an y analogous term
is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply; provided, further, that no Change in Control will be deemed
to occur upon announcement or co mmencement of a tender offer or upon a potential takeover or upon stockholder approval of a merger or other
transaction, in each case without a requirement that the Change in Control actually occur.
I f required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such
transaction is not also a “change in the ownership or effective control  of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of
the assets of” the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative  definition
thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s consent, amend the definition of “Change in Control” to conform to
the definition of “Change in Control” under  Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(h)“Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.
(i)“Committee” me ans a committee of one (1) or more Directors to whom authority has been delegated by the Board in accordance with
Section 2(c).
(j)“Common Stock” means the common stock of the Company.

Compute & Networking revenue – The increa se in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2024 was due to strengt h in Data Center computing and networking for accelerat ed computing and AI solutions. Revenue from GPU computing grew 166% year-
on-year and 257% compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024, was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU architecture computin g platform for training and
inferencing of large language models, recomm endation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was also up 114% year-on-year and 159%
compared to the first half  of last year driven by both InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue.
28Graphics revenue  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first  half of fiscal year 2024 was led
by higher sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income  – The increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compa red to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2024 in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue.
All Other operating loss – The incre ase in the second  quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024
was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and c ompensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic  region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises  and
gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal year 2025, r espectively , and 55% and 59% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively .
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct cus tomers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integ rators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal re sources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service provide rs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Comp ute & Networking segment, are
presented in the following table:
 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended

Customer A 14 % 14 %
Customer B 11 % *
Customer C 11 % *
Customer D 10 %  10 %
Customer E * 10 %
* Less than 10% of total revenue
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distrib utors, including
through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represent 10% or more of total revenue attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
For the first half of fiscal year 202 5, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products from system integrators and distributors, including from
Customer E, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable  to the Compute & Networking segment.
Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data
 and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may dif fer from our estimates.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,  and this trend may continue.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.
Our overall gross margi n increased to 75.1% and 76.6% for the second quart er and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , from 70.1% and 68.2% for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The increases in the second quarter and first half  of fiscal year 2025 compared to the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 154% and 234% for the second quarter and first half of
 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively ,  and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 millio n and $199 million for the second quarter  and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively . The net effect on
our
29gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively .
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $576 million and $709 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal  year 2024,
respectively . Sales of previously reserved invent ory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $84 million and
$134 million  for the seco nd quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively . The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 3.6% and
2.8% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, re spectively .
We expect our Data Center mix to continue to shift to new products in the second half of fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in
the mid-70% range.

The increases in research and development expenses for the second q uarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 were driven by 35% and 34% increase in
compensation and benefits, including stock-bas ed compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases,  and 118% and 117% increase in
compute and infrastructure investments, respectively .
The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 20 25 was primarily driven by compensation and
benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.
For fiscal year 2025, we expect operating expenses to g row in the mid to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products.

The increas es in interest income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025 was due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and publicly-held debt
secu rity balances.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other , net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in  privately-held equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact
of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other , net, compared to the second quarter and first half of fis cal year 2024 was primarily driven by an
increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statem ents in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity
securities.
30Income T axes
We recognized i ncome tax expense of $2.6 billion and $5.0 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and $793 million and
$958 million for the second quarter and first half of  fiscal year 2024, respectively . Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.6%
and 13.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively , and 11.4%  and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,
respectively .
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intang ible income deduction relative to the increase
in income before income tax.
Given our current and anticipated future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation  allowance associated with c ertain state deferred tax assets in
the near term, which would decrease our income  tax expense for the period the release is recor ded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release
could  vary based on our assessment of all available evidence.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (8, 877) $ (1,287)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (19,665) $ (5,479)
Our investm ent policy requires the purchase of high-rated fixed income securities, the diversi fication of investment types a nd credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2024  due to growth in revenue, partially
offset by higher tax paym ents. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2025 reflects the strong revenue growth, partially offse t
by $2.8 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first half of fiscal  year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of
marketable securities, and acquisition of land and buildings.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2025 compared  to the first half of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and m arketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of July 28, 2024, we
had $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liqui dity to meet our operating requirements for at least
the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our  liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-he ld equity securities,  debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by hig hly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt
securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Co nsolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
31Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable se curities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketab le securities held outside the U.S.
as of July 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Payment from customers, per our standard paym ent term s, is generally due shortly after delivery  of products, availability of software licenses or commencement
of services.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the second quarter and first half of fisca l year 2025, we paid $246 million and $344 million, respectively , in quarterly cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our  Board of Directors' continuing determination that the
dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On June 7, 2024, we increased our qua rterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-Stock Split basis to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024. Our
quarterly cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024.
During the second quarter and  first half of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 62.8 million and 162.1 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion and
$15.1 billion, respectively . As of July 28, 2024, we were authorized, su bject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $7.5 billion of our common stock. On
August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approve d an additional $50.0 billion to our share repurchase authoriz ation, without expiration. As of August 26, 2024, a
total of $53.9 billion was available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while main taining
adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment
opportunities. W e plan to continue share repu rchases this fiscal year .
From April 29, 2024 through August 26, 2024, we repurchased 31.5 million shares for $3.6 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
The U.S. Inflation Reduc tion Act of  2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost a nd was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $186 million recorded in non-current income tax p ayable as of
July 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability , interest payme nts, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the
underlying income tax  positions and the timing of
32the ef fective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the cont ractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations
from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for th e fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report o n Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024
for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations,  refer to Notes 2,

foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 20 24.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of July 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined  in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 (e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
i nformation we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and f orms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Of ficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions reg arding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or ar e reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update  much of
our existing core financia l systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will
occur in phases. W e will cont inue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially af fect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our manage ment, includ  ing our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control sys tem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further , the design of a control system must re flect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation o f controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any , within NVIDIA  have been detected.
33Part II. Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Pa rt I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “L egal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk facto rs liste d below , there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A  of our  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA  common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Ite m 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2024, and below . Any
one of  those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends  and uncertainties not present ly known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.
Long manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply an d component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,
has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and asse mb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component
or capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a  quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as
we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in  both product shortages and
excess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advanc e of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-
term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments f or capacity to address our business needs, or our
long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary fo r the
finished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited  supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 m onths. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future
supply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scal e their capabilities to meet
our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply
commitments at th e same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additio nal factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’  future demand for our pr oducts,
or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
 •competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•changes in business and economic conditions;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues ;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•the availability of suf ficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting  in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end-use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products;
•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated computing,  AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
34•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products; or
•government a ctions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
We continue to increase our supply and capacit y purchases with existing and new supplier s to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have
also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.  The increased purchase
volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with
variations in productio n planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to
increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incu r inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments
exceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may cha nge or may not be correct, as we have
experienced in the past.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare  to ship and support
new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.
The computing industr y is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI
opportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center arc hitectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year
and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the la rger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating
product transi tions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in
our revenue . We have experienced and may in the fut ure experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate
transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and f uture architecture transitions. If we are unable to
execute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and comp lexity of
newly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other
costs or result in produc t delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory pro visions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the
future.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product road map may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may  not be
able to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple pro duct archit ectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customer s often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through
multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by o ur multiple OEMs, ODMs, system
integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have
impacted and c ould in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various
downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers'  future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely  basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be
able to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient sup ply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill
our custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputa tion
could be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any
one component have had and may  have a broader revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may
not be able  to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including
due to channel pricing programs that we have imple mented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may
need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a  result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and rec orded impairments and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of
our historical  lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of
35these impac ts has increased and may continue  to increase as our purchase obligations an d prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and
become a greater portion of our total supply . All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Demand  estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to
generate significant revenue from them. Recent   technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for
Data Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multi ple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with
any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
Challenges  in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natur al disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers,  contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed a nd marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future
impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, se veral years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to
be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact  of
cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new
compute technologies, price change s in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in
the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the futu re impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further
impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not  limited to, the Ethereum 2.0
merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sale s of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or
previously sold products may be resold online or on the unau thorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and
reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.
Additionally , we depend  on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publi shers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by
developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our p latforms, or failure by third-party content providers
or publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adverse ly affect
customer demand.
We receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to
customers who purchase directly or  indirectl y from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of
these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited numb er of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to direct Customers, A, B,
C and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal  year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to
the Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio throug h their
channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our
processors. We have a small number of  partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly
complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key custome rs. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their
ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to custome rs. In the future, these
partners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.
Because most of  our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little
notice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or custome rs may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and
our partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our pr oducts, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’
purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,  distributors
and other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators
and distributors, includin g through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &
Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supp ly availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors
and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amoun t of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them,
36our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’  trade restrictions or any  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to whic h our business is subject, and political and other actions may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas inclu ding, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; impor t and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreig n exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; data priva cy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;
environmental, health, and s afety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,  and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to
manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors , suppliers, customers or agents will not  violate applicable laws
or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions
against us,  our officers, or our employees, prohib itions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations
to which we are subject, or changes to their inte rpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For  example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result
of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity v ulnerabilities and risks.
Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States,
the United Ki ngdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Author ity collected information from us regarding our business and
competition in the graph ics card and cloud service provider marke t as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received
requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, a nd South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs,
our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions
on the hardw are, software, and system s used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June
2024 and will be implemented in phases betwee n now and 2030. The State of Calif ornia, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions
under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, d elay or halt deployment of new systems
using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or
regulation s or their interpretation and enforceme nt could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,
restrictions and controls on imports or  exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our
shipments. Additionally , changes in the public perception of governments in  the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our
business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security polic ies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sa nctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with  entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’ s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligation s and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U .S. laws, even if the violation oc curred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial co ndition.
For example , in response to the war in Ukrain e, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, s ervices and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently , the war in Ukr aine has impacted sales in EMEA  and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasi ng focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that ta rget products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service of ferings.
Concerns regardin g third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests , including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could  in the f uture result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and c ould in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our busines s and financial results.
37Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology , including but not limited to AI technologies.
As ge opolitic al tensions have increased, semic onductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export
control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in t he U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted . Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to Chi na, and could negatively
impact our manufacturin g, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and
could negatively a nd materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI,
which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be furthe r tightened, would further restric t our ability to export our technology , products, or services even
though comp etitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvanta ge for us and negatively impacting our business and financial
results. Expo rt controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream use rs of our products
to additional  restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacti ng our business and financial results. Controls could negatively
impact our  cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA  AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and
customers to provide services to their end custom ers, even outside China.
Export contr ols could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gam ing products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less  likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impactin g our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financ ial  results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.
Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to inclu de deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner . Addition al export restric tions may not only impact our ability to serve
overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide  our
products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our
sales and efforts to supply the China m arket and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators
conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any app licable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions
on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating  results and financial condition.
During the third quarter  of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and expo rt licensing requirements targeting China’ s semiconductor and
supercompu ting industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China  (including  Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other system s or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing r equirements also apply to any future NVIDIA  integrated
circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circu its. There are
also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in
China. During the second qu arter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countr ies in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to
China and Country Group s D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our
products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A80 0, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to
the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate par ent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China. On Octo ber 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,
H80 0, and L40S products. W e have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
Following these export controls, we transitioned  some operations, including certain testing, validatio n, and supply and distribution operations out of China and
Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distri bution
operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for
which the USG does not require a  license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing
requirements, we may seek a license for the customer . However , the licensing  process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a
license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved,  it may impose burdensome conditions that
we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that
38does not have clear standard s or an opportunity  for review . For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for
exports of products to customers in China. The license process for e xports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions
that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements  have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and
already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA  against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new 
restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed , and our competitive
position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes  in the USG’ s export controls, including further expansion of the
geographic,  customer , or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we
are unable to provide contractual warranty or othe r extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to
significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants an y requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose
burdensome conditions that we or our customers  or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certa in of our competitors,
as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to
pursue alternatives  to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may aga in change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial resu lts. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements, effectively exclu ding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG
has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms t o create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license
conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions su ch as requiring chip tracking and throttling
mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has
a lready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a
significant portion of our supply and dis tribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In
addition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export co ntrols may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to
those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our product s, which are warehoused in and distributed
from Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in serve rs
containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large cluster s for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a
disproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competit ors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.
Excessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions t o “design-out” certain
U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or
shifting export contr ols have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our
competitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our busin ess, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls
may negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets , such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is  ready for
market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,
which would be less likely t o be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and i ncreased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose
restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or  any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the
Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products mad e by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another
example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per
memory  bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way
that effectively prevents us from being able to de sign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center
products and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating result s and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the
products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
39Finally , our business depends on our abi lity to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that
negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or serv ices from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.

1. General.
(a )Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation
1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 199 8 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation
2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Followi ng the
Effective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the
terms of this Plan except as follows: from the  Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company
anticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Empl oyees, Directors or Consultants who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan
covering up to an aggrega te of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign
nationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Fo reign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all
of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that
t he issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of
shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards grant ed following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign
Transition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for  issuance under this Plan as
provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that
expire or terminate for any reaso n prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for
issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in th is Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted
under the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
(b)Eligible Award Re cipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (i i) Nonstatutory Stock Options,
(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance
Cash Awards, and (viii)  Other Stock Awards.(d)Purpose. The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive
Awards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide i ncentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any
Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit fr om increases in value of the Common
Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to  “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant
to the transition relief provided by the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in
effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by  the Board, in its sole discretion, in
accordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.
2. Administration.
(a)Administration by Board.  The Board will administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a
Committee or Committees, as provided in Section 2(c).
(b)Powers of Board. The Board will have th e power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(i) To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan will be granted Awards; (B)  when and how each
Award will be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not
be identical), including the time or t imes when a person will be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; (E) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to, or the cash value of, an Award; and (F) the Fair Ma rket Value applicable to a Stock Award.
(ii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its
administration. The Board,  in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award
Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to th e extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the
Plan or Award fully effective.
(iii) To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
(iv) To accelerate the time at  which an Award may be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it m ay be exercised or the time during which it
will vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued); provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
Plan to the c ontrary, the time at which a Participant’s Award may be exercised or the time during which a Participant’s Award or any part thereof
will vest may only be accelerated in the event of the Participant’s  death or Disability or in the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control.
(v) To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement,  suspension or
termination of the Plan will not materially impair a Participant’s rights under his or her then-outstanding Award without his or her written consent.
(vi) To amend the Plan in any respec t the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive
Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bri ng the Plan or Awards granted under
the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section 9(a) relating to
Capitalization Ad justments, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) mat erially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under
the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at w hich shares of Common
Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) materially expands the types of Awards
available for issuance under the Plan , but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements. Except as otherwise provided in
the Plan or an AwardAgreement, rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan  will not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless
(i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing.
(vii) To submit any  amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended
to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereu nder regarding the exclusion of performance-based
compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding
Incentive Sto ck Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.
(viii) To approve forms of Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Awards, including,
but not limited to, amendments to provi de terms more favorable than previously provided in the Award Agreement, subject to any specified limits
in the Plan that are not subject to Board discretion; provided however, that, except with respe ct to amendments that disqualify or impair the
status of an Incentive Stock Option or as otherwise provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, the rights under any Award will not be
materially impaire d by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant
consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitation s of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participant’s
consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary (A) to maintain the qualified status of the Award as a n
Incentive Stock Option, (B) to clarify the manner of exemption from, or to bring the Award into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
the related guidance thereunder, or (C) to comply with o ther applicable laws.
(ix) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best
interests of the Company and that are not in confli ct with the provisions of the Plan or Awards.
(x) To adopt such procedures or terms and sub-plans (none of which will be inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan) as are
necessary or desirable to  permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or
employed or located outside the United States.
(c)Delegation to Committee.
(i) Genera l. The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration
of the Plan is delegated to a Committee, the Committee will have, in connection  with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore
possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of
 the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee
or subcommittee), subject, however, to such resolutions,  not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by
the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan  with the Committee and may, at
any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.
(ii) Section 162(m) and Rule 16b-3 Compliance. The Committee may consist solely of two or  more Outside Directors, in
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3. In addition, the
Board or the Committee, in its s ole discretion, may (A) delegate to a Committee who need not be Outside Directors the authority to grant Awards
to eligible persons who are either (I) not then Covered Employees and are not expected t o be Covered Employees at the time of recognition of
income resulting from such Stock Award, or (II) not persons with respect to whom the Company wishes to comply with Section 162(m) of the
Code, and/ or (B) delegate to a Committee who need not be Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Stock Awards to eligible persons who
are not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
(d)Delegation  to Other Person or Body. The Board or any Committee may delegate to one or more persons or bodies the authority to do
one or more of the following to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) design ate recipients, other than Officers, of Stock Awards, provided that
no person or body may be delegated authority to grant a Stock Award to themself; (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock  subject
to such Stock Awards; and(iii) determine the terms of such Stock Awards; provided, however, that the Board or Committee action regarding such delegation will fix the
terms of such delegation  in accordance with applicable law, including without limitation Sections 152 and 157 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Unless provided otherwise in the Board or Committee action regarding such  delegation, each Stock Award granted pursuant to
this section will be granted on the applicable form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Board or the Committee,
with any mod ifications necessary to incorporate or reflect the terms of such Stock Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2(d), neither the Board nor any Committee may delegate to any per son or body (who is not a Director or that is not comprised solely of Directors,
respectively) the authority to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 13(x)(iii) below.
(e)Effect of Board ’s Decision. All determinations, interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to
review by any person and will be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(f)Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards. Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i) reduce the exercise
or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation  Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancel any outstanding Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the current Fair Market Value in exchange for cash o r other Stock
Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company have approved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.
(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Divide nds or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited, as applicable, with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award, as determined by the Board and contained in the applicable Award Agr eement; provided,
however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested
under the terms of such Award Agreement, (i i) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be
subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of such Award Ag reement (including, but not limited to, any
vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to the
Company on t he date, if any, such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to a failure to meet any vesting conditions under
the terms of such Award Agreement.
3.Shares Subject to the Plan.
(a)Sh are Reserve. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards  after the Effective Date will not exceed 10,289,710,640 shares
(the “2007 Plan Reserve”). Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) 152,767,766 shares, which is the total
re serve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the
shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans on t he Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000
shares that were approved at the Company’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Mee ting of
Stockholders), (iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 shares that
were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting o f Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2018
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockho lders, (vii)
733,103,298 shares that were added to reflect a 4-for-1 stock split effective July 19, 2021, (viii) 51,500,000 shares that were approved at the
Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholde rs, and (ix) 9,260,739,576 shares that were added to reflect a 10-for-1 stock split effective June
7, 2024. For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number of sha res of Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a). Shares may
be issued in conn ection with a merger or acquisition as permitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company
Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX Company Guide Section 711 or other applicable rule,  and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares
available for issuance under the Plan.
 The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 s tock split effective September 10, 2007.1
1(b)Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve.
(i) Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise te rminate, in
whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are
forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at thei r original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Company’s reacquisition or repurchase
rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or  condition required for the vesting of
such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or
repurchased by the Comp any, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
(ii) Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participan t
because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award (including any shares subject to a
Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant beca use the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock
Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in s hares of Common Stock, the
number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under
the Plan. If any shares subjec t to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in
satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number  of shares that are not delivered to the Participant
shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise or purchase price of any Stock Award, or the withholding of
taxes  incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual
delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered s hall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares
of Common Stock are repurchased by the Company on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of  a Stock Award,
then the number of shares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
(c)Incentive Stock Option Limit. Subject to the 2007 Plan Reserve and the pr ovisions of Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization
Adjustments, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock
Options under the  Plan (including Incentive Stock Options granted under the Prior Plans) will be 10,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
(d)Individual Award Limitations. Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a) relati ng to Capitalization Adjustments, no Participant will be
eligible to be granted during any fiscal year:
(i) Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Stock Awards whose value is determined by refer ence to an increase over an
exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more
than 80,000,000 shares of Comm on Stock;
(ii) Performance Stock Awards covering more than 80,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and
(iii) Performance Cash Awards with a value of more than $6,000,000.
If a Performance Stock Award is in  the form of an Option, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award limit. If a Performance
Stock Award could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the Performance Stock Award lim it.
(e)Source of Shares. The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including
shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or other wise.
4.Eligibility.
(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a “parent
corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as  such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than
Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants; provided, however, that Stoc k Awards may not be granted to
Employees, Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any “parent” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Rule 405 of the SecuritiesAct,  unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as “service recipient stock” under Section 409A of the Code (for example,
because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate tran saction such as a spin off transaction), (ii) the Company, in connection with
its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from Section 409A of the Code, or (iii) the  Company, in
connection with its legal counsel, has determined that such Stock Awards comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
(b)Ten Percent Stockholders. A Ten Percent S tockholder will not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such
Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant and the Optio n is not exercisable after the
expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
(c)Consultants. A Consultant will be eligible for the grant of an Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Re gistration Statement
under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (“Form S-8”) is available to register either the offer or the sale of
the Company’s securities to  such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the
Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of For m S-8.
5.Provisions Relating to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option or SAR will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board will deem appropriate. All Option s will be
separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate
certificate or certificates will be issued for s hares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically
designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option  but some portion or all of the Option fails to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The
provision s of separate Options or SARs need not be identical; provided, however, that each Award Agreement will include (through incorporation
of provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherw ise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(a) Term. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the
expiratio n of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Award Agreement (the “Expiration Date”).
(b)Exercise Price. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding T en Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the
Award Agreement to the contrary, the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will not be less than the Fair Market Value subject to  the
Option or SAR on the date the Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike
price lower than the Fair Market Value subject to the Awar d if such Award is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option
or stock appreciation right in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A and, if applicable, Secti on 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR
will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.
(c)Consideration. The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option will be p aid, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below.
The Board will have the authority to  grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to
use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to uti lize a particular method of payment. The methods of
payment permitted by this Section 5(c) are:
(i) by cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer payable to the Company;
(ii) pu rsuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance
of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or c heck) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay
the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;(iii) if an option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, by a “net  exercise” arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not 
exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided, however, that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent
of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise pric e not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued; provided,
further, that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable t hereafter to the extent that (A)
shares issuable upon exercise are reduced to pay the exercise price pursuant to the “net exercise,” (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as
a result of such exe rcise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
(iv) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board and specified in the applicable Award Ag reement.
(d)Exercise and Payment of a SAR. To exercise any outstanding SAR, the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the
Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Apprec iation Right Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution
payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value  (on the date of
the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is
vested under such SAR, and with respect to w hich the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date, over (B) the strike price. The appreciation
distribution may be paid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other fo rm of consideration, as determined by the
Board and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.
(e)Transferability of Options and SARs. The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such lim itations on the transferability of Options
and SARs as the Board will determine. If the Board determines that an Option or SAR will be transferable, the Option or SAR will contain such
additional term s and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the
following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:
 (i) Restrictions on Transfer. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or
pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below) and will be exercisa ble during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner consistent with appl icable tax and securities
laws upon the Participant’s request. Except as explicitly provided herein, neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.
(ii) Domestic Relations Orders. N otwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer,
an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or official marital settleme nt agreement; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
(iii) Beneficiary Designation. Notwithstanding the foregoi ng, subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer, a
Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company (o r the designated
broker), designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and
receive the Common Stock or other con sideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or
administrator of the Participant’s estate (or other party legally entitled to the Option or SAR proceeds)  will be entitled to exercise the Option or
SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However, the Company may prohibit designation of a
beneficiary at any  time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of
applicable laws or difficult to administer.
(f)Vesting Generally. The total numb er of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and therefore become
exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option or SAR may be subject to such other  terms and conditions on the
time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board
may deem appropriate. The ve sting provisions ofindividual Options or SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then the  Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service.
The provisions of this Section 5(f) are subject to any Option or SAR provisions governing th e minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to
which an Option or SAR may be exercised.
(g)Termination of Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other  agreement between
the Participant and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause or upon the Participant’s
death or Disability), the Participant  may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Award
as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time  ending on the earlier of (i) the date 90 days following the
termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agree ment. If,
after termination of Continuous Service, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the
Award Agreement (as applicable), the Option or  SAR will terminate.
(h)Extension of Termination Date. If the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service
(other than for Cause or upon the Participan t’s death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited solely because the issuance of shares of
Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the  Participant to short-swing liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act due to a transaction engaged in by the Participant prior to his or her termination of Continuous Service, then
the Option o r SAR will terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of 90 days after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous
Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not  be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the
Participant to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Optio n or SAR as set forth in
the Award Agreement. All determinations under this Section 5(h) will be made in the sole discretion of the Board.
(i)Disability of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in  the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant
and the Company, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s Disability,  the Participant may
exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service), but only wi thin such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date 12 months following such termination of Continuous
Service, or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the A ward Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service,
the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement (as applicable), the  Option
or SAR will terminate.
(j)Death of Participant. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and
the Company, in the event that (i)  a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant’s death (which termination event
will give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), or (ii) the  Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the
Award Agreement after the termination of the Participant’s Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event will not give ris e to
acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(f) above), then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled
to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of d eath) by the Participant’s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or
SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participa nt’s death, but only within the period
ending on the earlier of (A) the date 18 months following the date of death, or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in
the Award Ag reement. If, after the Participant’s death, the Option or SAR is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement (as applicable), the Option or SAR will terminate.
(k)Terminat ion for Cause. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant’s Award Agreement, or other individual written
agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant, if a Particip ant’s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option or
SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant’s termination of Continuous Service, and the Participant will be prohibited from ex ercising
his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.(l)Non-Exempt Employees. No Option or SAR granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for p urposes of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended, will be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of
grant of the Option or SAR (al though the Award may vest prior to such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity
Act, (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability, (ii) upon a Corporat e Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed,
continued, or substituted, (iii) upon a Change in Control, or (iv) upon the Participant’s retirement (as such term may be defined in the
Parti cipant’s Award Agreement or in another agreement between the Participant and the Company, or, if no such definition, in accordance with
the Company’s then current employment policies and guidelines),  the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six
(6) months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non- exempt employee in
connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or
required for compliance with the Worke r Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection
with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from  the employee’s regular rate of pay, the
provisions of this Section 5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.
6.Provisions of Stock  Awards other than Options and SARs.
(a)Restricted Stock Awards. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as
the Board will deem appropriat e. To the extent consistent with the Company’s Bylaws, at the Board’s election, shares of Common Stock may be
(x) held in book entry form subject to the Company’s instructions until any restrictions r elating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or
(y) evidenced by a certificate, which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of
Restricte d Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award
Agreements need not be identical, provided, however, that each Restricted Stock A ward Agreement will include (through incorporation of the
provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
(i) Consideration. A Re stricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A) cash, check, bank draft, money order or
electronic funds transfer payable to the Company, (B) past services rendered to the Company or an A ffiliate, or (C) any other form of legal
consideration (including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board, in its sole discretion, and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. Shar es of Common Stock awarded under a Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the
Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board; provided, however,  that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s
Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Award will become fully vested as of the date of
termination of  Continuous Service.
(iii) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates, the Company
may receive via a forfeiture condition or a repurcha se right any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not
vested as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreem ent.
(iv) Transferability. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by
the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set fo rth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as the Board will determine in its
sole discretion, so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms  of the Restricted
Stock Award Agreement.
(b)Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and
conditions as the Board will  deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to
time, and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need  not be identical, provided, however, that each
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement willinclude (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Award Agreement or otherwise) the s ubstance of each of the following
provisions:
(i) Consideration. At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board will determine the consideration, if any, to be
paid by the Participan t upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if
any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricte d Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration
that may be acceptable to the Board in its sole discretion and permissible under applicable law.
(ii) Vesting. At the time of the gran t of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the Board may impose such restrictions or conditions to the
vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate; provided, h owever, that in all cases, in the event a
Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Restricted Stock Unit Award will become fully vested as of
the date of t ermination of Continuous Service.
(iii) Payment. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock, their cash equivalent, any
combination thereof or in any other  form of consideration, as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreement.
(iv) Additional Restrictions. At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award, t he Board, as it deems appropriate, may
impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted
Stock Unit Award  to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.
(v) Termination of Participant’s Continuous Service. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award
Agreeme nt, such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant’s termination of Continuous
Service.
(c)Performance Awards.
(i) Performance Stock Awards.  A Performance Stock Award is a Stock Award that is payable (including that may be granted, vest
or exercised) contingent upon the attainment during a Performance Period of certain Performance Goals.  A Performance Stock Award may
require the completion of a specified period of Continuous Service. In the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a result of his
or her death, then the P erformance Stock Award will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of the target level of performance, will be fully
vested, as of the date of death, and shares thereunder will be issued promptly follo wing the date of death. The length of any Performance
Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during the Performance Period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such
Performance Goals h ave been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to the extent that an Award is not intended to
qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the  Board), in its sole discretion. In addition, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that cash may be
us ed in payment of Performance Stock Awards.
(ii) Performance Cash Awards. A Performance Cash Award is a cash award that is payable contingent upon the attainment during
a Performance Period of certain  Performance Goals. A Performance Cash Award may also require the completion of a specified period of
Continuous Service. The length of any Performance Period, the Performance Goals to be achieved duri ng the Performance Period, and the
measure of whether and to what degree such Performance Goals have been attained will be conclusively determined by the Committee (or, to
the extent that an Award is  not intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board), in its
sole discretion. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may provide for or, subject  to such terms and conditions as the Board or the
Committee, as applicable, may specify, may permit a Participant to elect for, the payment of any Performance Cash Award to be deferred to a
specified  date or event. The Board or the Committee, as applicable, may specify the form of payment of Performance Cash Awards, which may
be cash or other property, or may provide for a Participant to have the  option for his or her Performance Cash Award, or such portion thereof as
the Board or theCommittee, as applicable, may specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, t o the extent permitted by applicable
law and the applicable Award Agreement, the Board or the Committee, as applicable, may determine that Common Stock authorized under this
Plan may be used in paymen t of Performance Cash Awards, including additional shares in excess of the Performance Cash Award as an
inducement to hold shares of Common Stock.
(iii) Section 162(m) Compliance. Unless otherwise per mitted in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code
with respect to any Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” thereunder, the Committee will establish the  Performance
Goals applicable to, and the formula for calculating the amount payable under, the Award no later than the earlier of (a) the date 90 days after
the commencement of the applicable Performa nce Period, and (b) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and in any
event at a time when the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals remains substantially uncertain. Pr ior to the payment of any
compensation under an Award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee will
certify the extent to which any Perfo rmance Goals and any other material terms under such Award have been satisfied (other than in cases
where such relate solely to the increase in the value of the Common Stock). With respect to any Awar d intended to qualify as “performance-
based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due
upon the attainment of the a pplicable Performance Goals on the basis of any such further considerations as the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may determine.
(d)Other Stock Awards. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole  or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, Common Stock,
including the appreciation in value thereof may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and  the
preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan (including, but not limited to, Section 2(g)), the Board will have sole
and complete authority to determine the perso ns to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted, the number
of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awar ds and all other terms and
conditions of such Other Stock Awards; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as a
result of his or her death, then  any Other Stock Awards held by such Participant will become fully vested as of the date of termination of
Continuous Service.
7.Covenants of the Company.
(a)Availability of Shares. During the terms o f the Stock Awards, the Company will keep available at all times the number of shares of
Common Stock reasonably required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
(b)Securities Law Compliance. The Company will s eek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the
Plan, or any offerings made under the Plan, such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue an d sell shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of the Stock Awards; provided, however, that this undertaking will not require the Company to register under the Securities
Act the Plan, any Stock Award or  any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award nor seek to obtain such approval if
the cost or efforts to obtain the approval is unreasonable in relation to the value of the ben efits to be provided under the Plan, as determined by
the Company in its sole discretion. If, after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost, the Company is unable to obtain from any such
regulator y commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common
Stock under the Plan, the Company will be relieved from any liability for f ailure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock
Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of an Award or the subsequent iss uance of cash
or Common Stock pursuant to the Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities laws.
(c)No Obligation to Notify or Minimize Taxes. The Company will ha ve no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such Participant
as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore, the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or othe rwise advise
such holder of a pending termination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates has any duty or  obligation to minimize the tax consequences of an Award to the holder of such Award.8.Miscellaneous.
(a)Use of Proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards will consti tute general funds of the Company.
(b)Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Stock Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any
Participant will be deemed completed  as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Board, regardless of when the
instrument, certificate, or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually receiv ed or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that
the corporate records (e.g., Board consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.,
 exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the
papering of the Award Agreement, the corporate reco rds will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in
the Award Agreement.
(c)Stockholder Rights. No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of, or to ha ve any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award unless and until (i) such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of, or the issuance
o f shares under, the Award pursuant to its terms and (ii) the issuance of the Common Stock subject to such Award has been entered into the
books and records of the Company.
(d)No Employment or Other Se rvice Rights. Nothing in the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or
in connection with any Award granted pursuant to the Plan will confer upon any Participant any rig ht to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the
employment  of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause (provided in compliance with applicable local laws and the
Employee’s employment contract, if any), (ii) the service of a Consultant pur suant to the terms of such Consultant’s agreement with the
Company or an Affiliate, or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisi ons of
the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.
(e)Change in Time Commitment. In the event a Participant’s regular level of time commit ment in the performance of his or her services
for the Company or any Affiliates is reduced (for example, and without limitation, if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the
Employee has  a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Award to the Participant, the
Board has the right in its sole discretion (provided in compliance wi th applicable local laws) to (i) make a corresponding reduction in the number
of shares or cash amount subject to any portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date o f such change in time
commitment, and (ii) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction, extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Award. In the
event of any such reduction, the  Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Award that is so reduced.
(f)Incentive Stock Option Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the  time of grant) with respect to
which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company
and any Affiliates) exceeds  $100,000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing
Incentive Stock Options, the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according  to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise
do not comply with the rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option
Agree ment(s) or any Board or Committee resolutions related thereto.
(g)Investment Assurances. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any
Award,  (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant’s knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably sat isfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial
and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the me rits and risks of
exercising the Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock
subject to the Award for the Participant’ s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwisedistributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, will be inope rative if (A)
the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award has been registered under a then currently
effective registration statement under the Securiti es Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the
Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws . The Company may, upon
advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in
order to comply with applicable se curities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.
(h)Withholding Obligations. Unless prohibited by the terms of an Award Agreement, the Company may, i n its sole discretion, satisfy any
federal, state, foreign or local tax withholding obligation relating to an Award (including but not limited to income tax, social insurance
contributions, payment on  account or any other taxes) by any of the following means (in addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate) or by a combina tion of such means: (i) causing the Participant to tender a
cash payment; (ii)  withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in
co nnection with the Award; provided, however, that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the maximum amount of
tax required to be withheld by law (or such other amount as may be  necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes); (iii) withholding cash from an Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts  otherwise payable to the
Participant; or (v) by such other method as may be set forth in the Award Agreement.
(i)Electronic Delivery. Any reference herein to a “written” agreement or document will inc lude any agreement or document delivered
electronically, filed publicly at www.sec.gov (or any successor website thereto) or posted on the Company’s intranet.
(j)Deferrals. To the extent permitted by  applicable law, the Board, in its sole discretion, may determine that the delivery of Common Stock
or the payment of cash, upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Award may  be deferred and may establish programs
and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the
Code. Consistent  with Section 409A of the Code, the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise
providing services to the Company or an Affiliate. The Board is authorized  to make deferrals of Awards and determine when, and in what annual
percentages, Participants may receive payments, including lump sum payments, following the Participant’s termination of Continuous S ervice,
and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.
(k)Compliance with Section 409A. Unless otherwise expressly prov ided for in an Award Agreement, the Plan and Award Agreements will
be interpreted to the greatest extent possible in a manner that makes the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder exempt from Section 4 09A of
the Code, and, to the extent not so exempt, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. If the Board determines that any Award granted
hereunder is not exempt from and is therefore subject to  Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award will
incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, and to th e extent an
Award Agreement is silent on terms necessary for compliance, such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan  (and unless the Award Agreement specifically provides otherwise), if the shares of Common
Stock are publicly traded, and if a Participant holding an Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” und er Section 409A of the Code is a
“specified employee” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, no distribution or payment of any amount that is due because of a “separation
from service” (as defined  in Section 409A of the Code without regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date
that is six (6) months following the date of such Participant’s “separation fro m service” or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death, unless
such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code, and any amounts so deferred wil l be paid in
a lump sum on the day after such six (6) month period elapses, with the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule.(l)Clawback/Recovery. All Awards granted under the Plan will be su bject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the
Company is required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Compa ny’s
securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. In
addition, the Board may impose such other clawback,  recovery or recoupment provisions in an Award Agreement as the Board determines
necessary or appropriate, including but not limited to a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of  Common Stock or other
cash or property upon the occurrence of Cause.
9.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Other Corporate Events.
(a)Capitalization Adjustments. In the event of a Capitalizatio n Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the
class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and maximum n umber of securities
that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section 3(c); (iii) the class(es) and maximum number of
securities that may be awarded to any per son pursuant to Section 3(d); and (iv) the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of
stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments, and its determinat ion will be final, binding and conclusive.
(b)Dissolution or Liquidation. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of
the Company, and up on ten (10) days prior written notice, all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and
outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchas e or a forfeiture condition) will terminate immediately prior
to the completion of such dissolution or liquidation, and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company’s repurchase rights or a forfe iture
condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing
Continuous Service, provided, however, that the Board may, in  its sole discretion, cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested,
exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expire d or terminated)
before the dissolution or liquidation is completed but contingent on its completion.
(c)Corporate Transaction.
(i) Stock Awards May Be Assumed. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock  Award Agreement, in the event of a Corporate
Transaction, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation’s parent company) may assume or
continue any or  all Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or may substitute similar stock awards for Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan
(including but not limited to, awards to acquire the same consideration  paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Corporate
Transaction), and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company in respect of Common Stock issued pursuant to Stock Award s
may be assigned by the Company to the successor of the Company (or the successor’s parent company, if any), in connection with such
Corporate Transaction. A surviving corporation or acquiring corpor ation (or its parent) may choose to assume or continue only a portion of a
Stock Award or substitute a similar stock award for only a portion of a Stock Award.
(ii) Stock Awards Not Assumed Held by Cu rrent Participants. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock Award Agreement
(including an option and stock award agreement subject to the terms of the Prior Plans, which terms remain applicable as to  outstanding options
and stock awards thereunder), in the event of a Corporate Transaction in which the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or its parent
company) does not assume or continu e any or all outstanding Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards for such outstanding Stock
Awards, then with respect to Stock Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and t hat are held by Participants whose
Continuous Service has not terminated prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction (referred to as the “Current Participants”), the
vesting of such Stock  Awards (and, if applicable, the time at which such Stock Awards may be exercised) will (contingent upon the effectiveness
of the Corporate Transaction) be accelerated in full to a date prior to the e ffective time of such Corporate Transaction as the Board will determine
(or, if the Board will not determine such a date, to the date that is five business (5) days prior to the effective time of the  Corporate Transaction),
and such StockAwards will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, and any reacquisition or
repurchase rights  held by the Company with respect to such Stock Awards will lapse (contingent upon the effectiveness of the Corporate
Transaction).
(iii) Stock Awards Not Assumed Held by Persons other than Current Par ticipants. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock
Award Agreement (including an option and stock award agreement subject to the terms of the Prior Plans, which terms remain applicable as to
outstandi ng options and stock awards thereunder), in the event of a Corporate Transaction in which the surviving corporation or acquiring
corporation (or its parent company) does not assume or continue any or  all outstanding Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards for such
outstanding Stock Awards, then with respect to Stock Awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and that are h eld by
persons other than Current Participants, the vesting of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time at which such Stock Award may be
exercised) will not be accelerated and such Stock Awards  (other than a Stock Award consisting of vested and outstanding shares of Common
Stock not subject to the Company’s right of repurchase), upon advance written notice by the Company of at least five (5 ) business days to the
holders of such Stock Awards, will terminate if not exercised (if applicable) prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction; provided,
however, that any reacquisition  or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to such Stock Awards will not terminate and may
continue to be exercised notwithstanding the Corporate Transaction.
(d)Change in Control.
(i) Sto ck Awards May Be Assumed. Except as otherwise stated in the Stock Award Agreement, in the event of a Change in
Control, any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquirin g corporation’s parent company) may assume or continue

following events:
(i) any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company represent ing more than 50%
of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Cha nge in Control will not be deemed to occur (A) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by
an investor, any affiliate thereof or any other Exchange Act Person that acquires the Compa ny’s securities in a transaction or series of related
transactions the primary purpose of which is to obtain financing for the Company through the issuance of equity securities, or (B) solely because

power of the surviving Entity in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction or (B) more than 50% of the combined outstanding voting power
of the parent of the surviving Entit y in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction, in each case in substantially the same proportions as
their Ownership of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to s uch transaction;

election) of any new Board member was approved orrecommended by a majority  vote of the members of the Incumbent Board then still in office, such new member will, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered as a member of the Incumbent Board.
For purposes of determining voting p ower under the term Change in Control, voting power will be calculated by assuming the conversion of
all equity securities convertible (immediately or at some future time) into shares entitled to vote , but not assuming the exercise of any warrant or
right to subscribe to or purchase those shares. In addition, (A) the term Change in Control will not include a sale of assets, merger or other
transac tion effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company, and (B) the definition of Change in Control (or any
analogous term) in an individual written agreement between the Co mpany or any Affiliate and the Participant will supersede the foregoing

is set forth in such an individual written agreement, the foregoing definition will apply; provided, further, that no Change in Control will be deemed
to occur upon announcement or co mmencement of a tender offer or upon a potential takeover or upon stockholder approval of a merger or other
transaction, in each case without a requirement that the Change in Control actually occur.
I f required for compliance with Section 409A of the Code, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if such
transaction is not also a “change in the ownership or effective control  of” the Company or “a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of
the assets of” the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative  definition
thereunder). The Board may, in its sole discretion and without a Participant’s consent, amend the definition of “Change in Control” to conform to

(h)“Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including any applicable regulations and guidance thereunder.
(i)“Committee” me ans a committee of one (1) or more Directors to whom authority has been delegated by the Board in accordance with

(k)“Company” me","Based on the analysis of Nvidia's 10-K report, several areas can be identified for potential cost savings, operational efficiencies, and expense minimization to enhance profitability. Here are the key findings and recommendations:

### 1. **Cost of Revenue Management**
- **Current Situation**: The cost of revenue has decreased from 29.9% to 24.9% year-over-year, indicating improved efficiency in production and sales.
- **Recommendation**: Continue to optimize supply chain management and negotiate better terms with suppliers to further reduce costs. Implementing just-in-time inventory systems could minimize excess inventory costs.

### 2. **Research and Development (R&D) Expenses**
- **Current Situation**: R&D expenses have increased significantly, accounting for 10.3% of revenue, up from 15.1% a year ago. This reflects a strategic investment in innovation, particularly in AI and GPU technologies.
- **Recommendation**: While maintaining a strong focus on innovation, consider prioritizing projects with the highest potential return on investment. Implementing a more rigorous project evaluation process could help in reallocating resources to the most promising initiatives.

### 3. **Sales, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses**
- **Current Situation**: SG&A expenses have decreased from 4.7% to 2.8% of revenue, indicating improved efficiency in administrative functions.
- **Recommendation**: Continue to streamline administrative processes through automation and digital transformation. Regularly review vendor contracts and service agreements to ensure competitive pricing and service levels.

### 4. **Stock-Based Compensation**
- **Current Situation**: The increase in stock-based compensation is a significant factor in the rise of operating expenses.
- **Recommendation**: Consider revising the stock compensation structure to align more closely with performance metrics. This could help control costs while still incentivizing employees effectively.

### 5. **Inventory Management**
- **Current Situation**: Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations have been substantial, indicating challenges in inventory management.
- **Recommendation**: Implement advanced inventory management systems that utilize predictive analytics to better align inventory levels with demand forecasts. This could reduce excess inventory and associated costs.

### 6. **Geographic Revenue Concentration**
- **Current Situation**: A significant portion of revenue (57%) comes from international markets, which may expose Nvidia to geopolitical risks and currency fluctuations.
- **Recommendation**: Diversify the customer base geographically to mitigate risks. Explore opportunities in emerging markets where demand for AI and GPU technologies is growing.

### 7. **Tax Efficiency**
- **Current Situation**: The effective tax rate has increased, impacting net income.
- **Recommendation**: Engage in tax planning strategies to optimize the tax burden. This could include utilizing available tax credits, deductions, and incentives related to R&D and international operations.

### 8. **Debt Management**
- **Current Situation**: Nvidia has a manageable level of debt, but interest expenses could be optimized.
- **Recommendation**: Consider refinancing existing debt at lower interest rates if market conditions allow. This could reduce interest expenses and improve cash flow.

### 9. **Operational Efficiency through Technology**
- **Current Situation**: Nvidia is investing heavily in AI and automation technologies.
- **Recommendation**: Continue to leverage AI and machine learning to enhance operational efficiencies across all departments, from manufacturing to customer service. This could lead to significant cost savings and improved service delivery.

### Conclusion
By focusing on these areas, Nvidia can further enhance its profitability while maintaining its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of strategies will be essential to adapt to market changes and internal performance metrics.",2024-08-31T16:29:38.893132
