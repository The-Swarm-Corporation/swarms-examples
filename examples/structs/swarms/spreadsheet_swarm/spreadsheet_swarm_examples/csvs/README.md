### Misc Agent Settings
We provide vast array of features to save agent states using json, yaml, toml, upload pdfs, batched jobs, and much more!

```python
# # Convert the agent object to a dictionary
print(agent.to_dict())
print(agent.to_toml())
print(agent.model_dump_json())
print(agent.model_dump_yaml())

# Ingest documents into the agent's knowledge base
agent.ingest_docs("your_pdf_path.pdf")

# Receive a message from a user and process it
agent.receive_message(name="agent_name", message="message")

# Send a message from the agent to a user
agent.send_agent_message(agent_name="agent_name", message="message")

# Ingest multiple documents into the agent's knowledge base
agent.ingest_docs("your_pdf_path.pdf", "your_csv_path.csv")

# Run the agent with a filtered system prompt
agent.filtered_run(
    "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria?"
)

# Run the agent with multiple system prompts
agent.bulk_run(
    [
        "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria?",
        "Another system prompt",
    ]
)

# Add a memory to the agent
agent.add_memory("Add a memory to the agent")

# Check the number of available tokens for the agent
agent.check_available_tokens()

agent.get_docs_from_doc_folders()

# Activate agent ops
agent.activate_agentops()
agent.check_end_session_agentops()

# Dump the model to a JSON file
agent.model_dump_json()
print(agent.to_toml())

```



### `Agent`with Pydantic BaseModel as Output Type
The following is an example of an agent that intakes a pydantic basemodel and outputs it at the same time:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from swarms import Agent
from swarm_models import Anthropic


# Initialize the schema for the person's information
class Schema(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., title="Name of the person")
    agent: int = Field(..., title="Age of the person")
    is_student: bool = Field(..., title="Whether the person is a student")
    courses: list[str] = Field(
        ..., title="List of courses the person is taking"
    )


# Convert the schema to a JSON string
tool_schema = Schema(
    name="Tool Name",
    agent=1,
    is_student=True,
    courses=["Course1", "Course2"],
)

# Define the task to generate a person's information
task = "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Person Information Generator",
    system_prompt=(
        "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"
    ),
    # Set the tool schema to the JSON string -- this is the key difference
    tool_schema=tool_schema,
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=3,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    interactive=True,
    # Set the output type to the tool schema which is a BaseModel
    output_type=tool_schema,  # or dict, or str
    metadata_output_type="json",
    # List of schemas that the agent can handle
    list_base_models=[tool_schema],
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json",  # or soon yaml
)

# Run the agent to generate the person's information
generated_data = agent.run(task)

# Print the generated data
print(f"Generated data: {generated_data}")


```

### Multi Modal Autonomous Agent
Run the agent with multiple modalities useful for various real-world tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and health.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import Agent

from swarm_models import GPT4VisionAPI

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()


# Initialize the language model
llm = GPT4VisionAPI(
    openai_api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    max_tokens=500,
)

# Initialize the task
task = (
    "Analyze this image of an assembly line and identify any issues such as"
    " misaligned parts, defects, or deviations from the standard assembly"
    " process. IF there is anything unsafe in the image, explain why it is"
    " unsafe and how it could be improved."
)
img = "assembly_line.jpg"

## Initialize the workflow
agent = Agent(
    agent_name = "Multi-ModalAgent",
    llm=llm, 
    max_loops="auto", 
    autosave=True, 
    dashboard=True, 
    multi_modal=True
)

# Run the workflow on a task
agent.run(task, img)
```
----


### `ToolAgent`
ToolAgent is an agent that can use tools through JSON function calling. It intakes any open source model from huggingface and is extremely modular and plug in and play. We need help adding general support to all models soon.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

from swarms import ToolAgent
from swarms.utils.json_utils import base_model_to_json

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "databricks/dolly-v2-12b",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    device_map="auto",
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("databricks/dolly-v2-12b")


# Initialize the schema for the person's information
class Schema(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., title="Name of the person")
    agent: int = Field(..., title="Age of the person")
    is_student: bool = Field(
        ..., title="Whether the person is a student"
    )
    courses: list[str] = Field(
        ..., title="List of courses the person is taking"
    )


# Convert the schema to a JSON string
tool_schema = base_model_to_json(Schema)

# Define the task to generate a person's information
task = (
    "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"
)

# Create an instance of the ToolAgent class
agent = ToolAgent(
    name="dolly-function-agent",
    description="Ana gent to create a child data",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    json_schema=tool_schema,
)

# Run the agent to generate the person's information
generated_data = agent.run(task)

# Print the generated data
print(f"Generated data: {generated_data}")

```


### `Task`
For deeper control of your agent stack, `Task` is a simple structure for task execution with the `Agent`. Imagine zapier like LLM-based workflow automation.

‚úÖ Task is a structure for task execution with the Agent. 

‚úÖ Tasks can have descriptions, scheduling, triggers, actions, conditions, dependencies, priority, and a history. 

‚úÖ The Task structure allows for efficient workflow automation with LLM-based agents.

```python
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from swarms import Agent, OpenAIChat, Task

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()


# Define a function to be used as the action
def my_action():
    print("Action executed")


# Define a function to be used as the condition
def my_condition():
    print("Condition checked")
    return True


# Create an agent
agent = Agent(
    llm=OpenAIChat(openai_api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
)

# Create a task
task = Task(
    description=(
        "Generate a report on the top 3 biggest expenses for small"
        " businesses and how businesses can save 20%"
    ),
    agent=agent,
)

# Set the action and condition
task.set_action(my_action)
task.set_condition(my_condition)

# Execute the task
print("Executing task...")
task.run()

# Check if the task is completed
if task.is_completed():
    print("Task completed")
else:
    print("Task not completed")

# Output the result of the task
print(f"Task result: {task.result}")
```

# Multi-Agent Orchestration:
Swarms was designed to facilitate the communication between many different and specialized agents from a vast array of other frameworks such as langchain, autogen, crew, and more.

In traditional swarm theory, there are many types of swarms usually for very specialized use-cases and problem sets. Such as Hiearchical and sequential are great for accounting and sales, because there is usually a boss coordinator agent that distributes a workload to other specialized agents.

### `SequentialWorkflow`
Sequential Workflow enables you to sequentially execute tasks with `Agent` and then pass the output into the next agent and onwards until you have specified your max loops.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

from swarm_models import Anthropic


# Initialize the language model agent (e.g., GPT-3)
llm = Anthropic()

# Initialize agents for individual tasks
agent1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Blog generator",
    system_prompt="Generate a blog post like stephen king",
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    tools=[],
)
agent2 = Agent(
    agent_name="summarizer",
    system_prompt="Sumamrize the blog post",
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    tools=[],
)

# Create the Sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(
    agents=[agent1, agent2], max_loops=1, verbose=False
)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run(
    "Generate a blog post on how swarms of agents can help businesses grow."
)

```

------

## `AgentRearrange`
Inspired by Einops and einsum, this orchestration techniques enables you to map out the relationships between various agents. For example you specify linear and sequential relationships like `a -> a1 -> a2 -> a3` or concurrent relationships where the first agent will send a message to 3 agents all at once: `a -> a1, a2, a3`. You can customize your workflow to mix sequential and concurrent relationships. [Docs Available:](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

from swarms import Agent, Edge, GraphWorkflow, Node, NodeType

from swarm_models import OpenAIChat

load_dotenv()

## `MixtureOfAgents`
This is an implementation from the paper: "Mixture-of-Agents Enhances Large Language Model Capabilities" by together.ai, it achieves SOTA on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench and FLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. Great for tasks that need to be parallelized and then sequentially fed into another loop

```python
from swarms import Agent, OpenAIChat, MixtureOfAgents

    llm=OpenAIChat(),

## Folder Structure
The swarms package has been meticlously crafted for extreme use-ability and understanding, the swarms package is split up into various modules such as `swarms.agents` that holds pre-built agents, `swarms.structs`¬†that holds a vast array of structures like `Agent` and multi agent structures. The 3 most important are `structs`, `models`, and `agents`.

```sh
