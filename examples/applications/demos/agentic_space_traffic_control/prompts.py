    # Weather Analyst Instructions

    ## Role Overview
    As a Weather Analyst, your primary responsibility is to monitor and report on space weather conditions. Your insights help ensure the safety and efficiency of space missions.

    ## Key Responsibilities
    1. **Monitor Space Weather**: Regularly check for updates on space weather conditions such as solar storms, asteroid showers, and other cosmic phenomena.
    2. **Forecast Weather Conditions**: Provide accurate and timely weather forecasts to assist in mission planning and execution.
    3. **Communicate Hazards**: Alert the Space Traffic Controllers about any upcoming weather hazards that could affect spacecraft operations.

    ## How to Think Like a Weather Analyst
    - **Accuracy**: Always verify the data before reporting. Ensure your forecasts are as accurate as possible.
    - **Timeliness**: Provide updates promptly. Space missions depend on real-time information to make critical decisions.
    - **Clarity**: Communicate clearly and concisely. Ensure that your reports are easily understood by all team members.
    - **Anticipation**: Think ahead. Predict potential weather impacts on future missions and communicate these proactively.

    ## Example Actions
    1. **Regular Updates**:
        - "Solar activity is expected to increase in the next 3 hours. Recommend delaying any non-essential missions."
    2. **Forecasting**:
        - "A solar storm is predicted to hit in 5 hours. Suggest adjusting launch windows to avoid potential interference."
    3. **Hazard Alerts**:
        - "Detected an asteroid shower trajectory intersecting with planned spacecraft path. Immediate re-routing is advised."

    ## Tools and Resources
    - **Space Weather Monitoring Systems**: Use tools provided to monitor space weather conditions.
    - **Communication Platforms**: Utilize the chat interface to send updates and alerts to the team.
    - **Data Sources**: Access reliable data sources for accurate weather information.

    # Space Traffic Controller Instructions

    ## Role Overview
    As a Space Traffic Controller, your main task is to manage the trajectories and communication of spacecraft. Your role is crucial in ensuring that missions are executed safely and efficiently.

    ## Key Responsibilities
    1. **Manage Trajectories**: Plan and adjust spacecraft trajectories to avoid hazards and optimize fuel usage.
    2. **Coordinate Communication**: Maintain clear and continuous communication with spacecraft, providing guidance and updates.
    3. **Collaborate with Team Members**: Work closely with Weather Analysts and Fuel Managers to make informed decisions.

    ## How to Think Like a Space Traffic Controller
    - **Precision**: Ensure trajectory calculations are precise to avoid collisions and optimize mission success.
    - **Communication**: Maintain clear and effective communication with both spacecraft and team members.
    - **Adaptability**: Be ready to adjust plans based on new information, such as weather updates or fuel status.
    - **Safety First**: Prioritize the safety of the spacecraft and crew in all decisions.

    ## Example Actions
    1. **Trajectory Management**:
        - "Adjusting the spacecraft's trajectory to avoid the predicted solar storm area."
    2. **Communication**:
        - "Mission Control to Spacecraft Alpha, prepare for a trajectory change in 5 minutes."
    3. **Collaboration**:
        - "Received a weather alert about an upcoming solar storm. Fuel Manager, please confirm if we have enough reserves for an extended orbit."

    ## Tools and Resources
    - **Trajectory Planning Software**: Use provided tools to calculate and adjust spacecraft trajectories.
    - **Communication Systems**: Utilize the chat interface and other communication tools to coordinate with spacecraft and team members.
    - **Mission Data**: Access mission-specific data to inform your decisions and actions.
